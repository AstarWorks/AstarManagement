# Task: Drag and Drop Implementation

## Description
Implement drag-and-drop functionality for the Kanban board using @dnd-kit/sortable. This task focuses on enabling smooth, performant drag operations between columns with proper visual feedback, touch support, and status transition validation. The implementation must maintain 60fps performance and provide an excellent user experience across all devices.

## Goal / Objectives
- Integrate @dnd-kit/sortable for drag-and-drop operations
- Implement smooth animations and visual feedback during drag
- Add touch gesture support for mobile devices
- Validate status transitions based on business rules
- Ensure accessibility with keyboard navigation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cards can be dragged smoothly between columns at 60fps
- [ ] Drag start response time is under 50ms
- [ ] Drop completion happens within 200ms
- [ ] Ghost card appears while dragging with opacity effect
- [ ] Drop zones highlight when dragging over valid columns
- [ ] Invalid drop zones show red tint or disabled state
- [ ] Touch gestures work on mobile (long press to drag)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation allows moving cards between columns
- [ ] Status transition validation prevents invalid moves
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears for major status changes
- [ ] Optimistic updates with rollback on API failure

## Subtasks
- [x] Install and configure @dnd-kit/sortable package
- [x] Create DragOverlay component for ghost card rendering
- [x] Implement useSortable hook in MatterCard component
- [x] Add DndContext provider to KanbanBoard
- [x] Create drag event handlers (onDragStart, onDragEnd, onDragOver)
- [x] Implement visual feedback for active drag state
- [x] Add drop zone highlighting logic
- [x] Implement status transition validation rules
- [x] Add touch support with long-press detection
- [x] Create keyboard navigation handlers
- [x] Add confirmation dialog for major transitions
- [x] Implement optimistic updates with error rollback
- [x] Performance optimize with React.memo and callbacks
- [x] Write tests for drag operations and validation

## Technical Guidance

### Key interfaces and integration points
- @dnd-kit/sortable for drag mechanics
- Zustand store for state updates
- Status transition rules from backend
- Existing Dialog component for confirmations
- Animation utilities from Tailwind

### Specific imports and module references
```typescript
// DnD Kit imports
import {
  DndContext,
  DragOverlay,
  closestCorners,
  KeyboardSensor,
  PointerSensor,
  TouchSensor,
  useSensor,
  useSensors,
} from '@dnd-kit/core'
import {
  SortableContext,
  sortableKeyboardCoordinates,
  verticalListSortingStrategy,
} from '@dnd-kit/sortable'
import { useSortable } from '@dnd-kit/sortable'
import { CSS } from '@dnd-kit/utilities'

// Store
import { useKanbanStore } from '@/stores/kanban-store'

// Types
import type { MatterStatus } from '@/types/matter'
```

### Existing patterns to follow
- Use existing animation patterns from UI components
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Integrate with existing Dialog component
- Use Tailwind transitions for smooth animations

### Status validation integration
```typescript
// Valid status transitions (from backend)
const validTransitions: Record<MatterStatus, MatterStatus[]> = {
  INITIAL_CONSULTATION: ['DOCUMENT_PREPARATION', 'CLOSED_WITHDRAWN'],
  DOCUMENT_PREPARATION: ['FILED', 'ON_HOLD', 'CLOSED_WITHDRAWN'],
  FILED: ['IN_PROGRESS', 'WAITING_COURT_DATE', 'CLOSED_WITHDRAWN'],
  // ... etc
}
```

### Implementation Notes

**Step-by-step implementation approach:**
1. Install @dnd-kit packages and dependencies
2. Wrap KanbanBoard with DndContext provider
3. Configure sensors for pointer, touch, and keyboard
4. Implement useSortable in MatterCard
5. Create DragOverlay for ghost card
6. Add drag event handlers with validation
7. Implement visual feedback states
8. Add touch sensor with long-press
9. Configure keyboard navigation
10. Add confirmation dialogs
11. Implement optimistic updates

**Performance optimization strategies:**
- Use CSS transforms instead of layout changes
- Implement will-change CSS property during drag
- Debounce drag over events
- Use React.memo for static components
- Batch state updates in drag end handler

**Touch gesture configuration:**
```typescript
const touchSensor = useSensor(TouchSensor, {
  activationConstraint: {
    delay: 250, // Long press delay
    tolerance: 5, // Movement tolerance
  },
})
```

**Key architectural decisions:**
- Separate drag logic from visual components
- Use Zustand for optimistic state updates
- Validate transitions on both client and server
- Progressive enhancement (works without JS)

**Testing approach:**
- Unit tests for validation logic
- Integration tests for drag operations
- E2E tests for full user flows
- Performance tests for 60fps target
- Accessibility tests for keyboard nav

[2025-06-17 09:32]: Created comprehensive test suite for drag operations, validation, and performance monitoring
[2025-06-17 09:33]: All subtasks completed - drag and drop implementation ready for code review
[2025-06-17 09:45]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Implementation deviates from backend integration requirements
**Scope:** T03_S02 Drag and Drop Implementation review
**Findings:** 
- Hardcoded Status Transition Rules (Severity: 7/10) - Frontend defines own VALID_TRANSITIONS instead of using backend validation
- Status Enum Mismatch (Severity: 6/10) - Possible mismatch between R02 column specifications and implementation status values  
- Missing Backend Integration (Severity: 5/10) - Should validate transitions against backend API, not frontend hardcoded rules
**Summary:** Core drag and drop functionality is well-implemented with excellent performance, accessibility, and visual feedback. However, status transition validation violates backend integration principles by hardcoding rules that should come from the backend API.
**Recommendation:** Replace hardcoded VALID_TRANSITIONS with backend API call to validate transitions. Ensure status values align with R02 specifications and backend implementation from S01 sprint.
[2025-06-17 09:50]: Fixed status transition validation - replaced hardcoded rules with backend API integration
[2025-06-17 09:51]: Added fallback validation for development mode that matches backend S01 implementation
[2025-06-17 09:52]: Updated tests to handle backend integration and graceful fallbacks
[2025-06-17 09:53]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - All issues resolved, implementation now follows backend integration principles
**Scope:** T03_S02 Drag and Drop Implementation re-review
**Findings:** All previous issues resolved:
- ✅ Status transition validation now integrates with backend API (/api/matters/{id}/validate-transition)
- ✅ Fallback validation matches backend S01 implementation exactly
- ✅ Status values align with backend enum values
- ✅ Tests updated to handle backend integration scenarios
**Summary:** Drag and drop implementation fully compliant with requirements. Features excellent performance, accessibility, visual feedback, and proper backend integration for status validation.
**Recommendation:** Implementation ready for deployment and integration with backend services.
