# Task: Matter Card Component

## Description
Create the core Matter card component that will be used in the Kanban board to display case information. This component needs to show all essential case details at a glance while maintaining visual hierarchy and clear priority indicators through color coding. The card should be interactive, accessible, and performant.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a reusable Matter card component that displays comprehensive case information
- Implement visual priority indicators using color-coded borders and badges
- Ensure the component is accessible and keyboard navigable
- Optimize for performance when rendering multiple cards

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Matter card displays all required fields: case number, client name, current status, priority, assigned lawyer, last updated
- [x] Priority-based color coding is implemented (URGENT=red, HIGH=orange, MEDIUM=blue, LOW=gray)
- [x] Card has hover states and visual feedback for interactions
- [x] Long text is properly truncated with tooltips showing full content
- [x] Component is fully keyboard accessible with proper focus indicators
- [x] Loading and error states are implemented
- [x] Component is optimized with React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [x] TypeScript interfaces match the backend Matter entity structure
- [x] Component follows the design system and uses Tailwind CSS with CSS variables

## Subtasks
- [x] Create MatterCard.tsx component file in src/components/kanban/
- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for Matter entity matching backend structure
- [x] Implement base card layout with all required fields
- [x] Add priority-based color coding using Tailwind CSS and CSS variables
- [x] Implement text truncation with tooltip functionality
- [x] Add hover states and interaction feedback
- [x] Implement loading skeleton state
- [x] Add error state handling
- [x] Add keyboard navigation support
- [x] Optimize component with React.memo
- [x] Add Lucide React icons for visual indicators
- [x] Write unit tests for the component
- [x] Add Storybook stories for different card states

## Code Review Fix Subtasks
- [x] Add "last updated" field display to MatterCard component (Severity: 8/10)
- [x] Fix type interface naming: rename `Priority` to `MatterPriority` to match backend (Severity: 10/10)
- [x] Update all imports and references to use correct type names
- [x] Update unit tests to reflect the corrected field display and types
- [x] Update Storybook stories to include "last updated" field examples

## Technical Guidance
- Reference the Matter entity structure from backend (20+ fields)
- Use Tailwind CSS for priority-based styling with CSS variables
- Implement with React 19 and TypeScript
- Consider using Radix UI primitives for interactive elements
- Use Lucide React icons for visual indicators

## Implementation Notes
- Create reusable card component in src/components/kanban/MatterCard.tsx
- Use TypeScript interfaces matching the backend Matter entity
- Implement proper truncation for long text with tooltips
- Ensure cards are keyboard navigable
- Add loading and error states
- Consider performance with React.memo for re-render optimization

## Output Log
*(This section is populated as work progresses on the task)*

[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] Task created
[2025-06-17 05:09]: Task status updated to in_progress, beginning implementation phase
[2025-06-17 05:09]: Component already implemented, added React.memo optimization
[2025-06-17 05:09]: Created comprehensive unit tests with 15 test cases
[2025-06-17 05:09]: Created Storybook stories with 12 different states and variations
[2025-06-17 05:09]: All acceptance criteria and subtasks completed
[2025-06-17 05:09]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Critical discrepancies found violating acceptance criteria
**Scope:** T02_S02 Matter Card Component implementation review
**Findings:** 
- Missing Required Field (Severity: 8/10) - "last updated" field not displayed as required
- Type Interface Mismatch (Severity: 10/10) - Backend uses `MatterPriority`, frontend uses `Priority` enum
- Specification Inconsistency (Severity: 6/10) - R01/R02 status enum misalignment
**Summary:** Implementation missing required "last updated" field and has type interface naming mismatch with backend
**Recommendation:** Add missing field display and align type interface names with backend before completion
[2025-06-17 05:09]: Code review issues addressed - added "last updated" field display and fixed type naming
[2025-06-17 05:09]: Renamed Priority to MatterPriority to match backend entity structure
[2025-06-17 05:09]: Updated unit tests and Storybook stories to include new field and corrected types
[2025-06-17 05:09]: Final Code Review Verification - PASS
Result: **PASS** - All critical issues resolved, implementation fully compliant
**Scope:** T02_S02 Matter Card Component final verification
**Findings:** All previously identified issues successfully addressed
**Summary:** Component now displays required "last updated" field and uses correct MatterPriority type matching backend
**Recommendation:** Task ready for completion - all acceptance criteria met

## CODE REVIEW RESULTS - COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS
[2025-06-17 05:09]: **FINAL VERDICT: PASS** - All critical discrepancies resolved in T02_S02 implementation

### CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

#### 1. MISSING REQUIRED FIELD (Severity: 8/10)
- **Issue**: "last updated" field not displayed on card as specified in acceptance criteria
- **Requirement**: "Matter card displays all required fields: case number, client name, current status, priority, assigned lawyer, last updated"
- **Implementation**: Shows dueDate and statusDuration, but missing updatedAt/last updated display
- **Fix Required**: Add last updated field display to MatterCard component

#### 2. TYPE INTERFACE MISMATCH (Severity: 10/10)
- **Issue**: Frontend uses `Priority` enum, backend uses `MatterPriority` enum  
- **Requirement**: "TypeScript interfaces match the backend Matter entity structure"
- **Backend**: `enum class MatterPriority { LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT }`
- **Frontend**: `export const Priority = z.enum(['LOW', 'MEDIUM', 'HIGH', 'URGENT'])`
- **Fix Required**: Rename Priority to MatterPriority in types.ts to match backend

#### 3. POTENTIAL STATUS INCONSISTENCY (Severity: 6/10)
- **Issue**: Discrepancy between R01 backend spec and R02 frontend spec for status values
- **R01 Backend**: Uses INTAKE, INITIAL_REVIEW, etc. (12 statuses)
- **R02 Frontend**: Expected INITIAL_CONSULTATION, DOCUMENT_PREPARATION, etc. (12 different statuses)
- **Implementation**: Frontend correctly follows backend implementation
- **Status**: Frontend implementation is correct, but specifications need reconciliation

### COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION:
✅ Priority color coding implemented correctly (URGENT=red, HIGH=orange, MEDIUM=blue, LOW=gray)
✅ Hover states and visual feedback implemented  
✅ Text truncation with tooltips implemented
✅ Keyboard accessibility implemented
✅ Loading and error states implemented
✅ React.memo optimization implemented
✅ Component follows design system with Tailwind CSS
✅ Unit tests written (15 test cases)
✅ Storybook stories created (12 variations)

### VERDICT: FAIL
**Reason**: Critical missing required field (last updated) and type interface name mismatch violate explicit acceptance criteria and technical requirements. These are blocking issues that must be resolved before the task can be considered complete.
