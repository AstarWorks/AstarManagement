# Task: Matter List Basic Data Grid Implementation

## Description
Implement a foundational matter listing component with core data grid functionality for the Aster Management system. This component will provide the essential features for displaying, sorting, and paginating legal matters efficiently. The implementation should leverage existing TanStack Query patterns for data fetching while focusing on creating a solid, performant base that can be extended with advanced features.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a reliable and performant matter list component that provides core functionality for viewing and navigating legal matters:
- Implement a responsive data grid with column display and formatting
- Add bidirectional column sorting capabilities
- Integrate server-side pagination for efficient data loading
- Ensure optimal performance with proper Vue reactivity patterns
- Maintain accessibility standards with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Provide clear loading and error states

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Data grid displays all essential matter fields with proper formatting
- [ ] Column sorting works bidirectionally for sortable fields (title, client, status, dates)
- [ ] Pagination controls display page navigation with configurable page sizes
- [ ] Component loads efficiently with initial page of data
- [ ] Loading states provide clear feedback during data fetching
- [ ] Error handling displays user-friendly messages for failures
- [ ] Mobile responsive design adapts layout for small screens
- [ ] Keyboard navigation allows basic table interaction
- [ ] Integration with existing TanStack Query hooks works correctly

## Subtasks
- [x] Create base DataTable component structure with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Define column configuration system with sorting capabilities
- [x] Implement table header with sortable column controls
- [x] Build table body with proper data rendering and formatting
- [x] Add pagination component with page size selector
- [x] Integrate useMattersQuery composable for data fetching
- [x] Implement loading skeleton for initial data load
- [x] Add error boundary with retry functionality
- [x] Create mobile-responsive table layout
- [x] Write unit tests for sorting and pagination logic
- [x] Document basic component usage and props

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Component Architecture
- Build on top of existing shadcn-vue table components
- Use Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript for type safety
- Create reusable column definition interface
- Implement clean separation between data and presentation logic

### Data Grid Structure
```typescript
interface DataTableProps {
  columns: ColumnDef[]
  pageSize?: number
  sortable?: boolean
}

interface ColumnDef {
  key: string
  header: string
  sortable?: boolean
  formatter?: (value: any) => string
  width?: string
}
```

### Sorting Implementation
- Use computed properties for sorted data
- Implement sort state management with reactive refs
- Support single column sorting initially
- Add visual indicators for sort direction

### Pagination Strategy
- Server-side pagination with TanStack Query
- Page size options: 10, 25, 50, 100
- Display total count and current range
- Prefetch adjacent pages for smoother navigation

### Mobile Considerations
- Horizontal scroll for full table on small screens
- Priority columns visible by default
- Consider card-based layout for very small screens
- Maintain touch-friendly controls
