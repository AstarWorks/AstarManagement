# Task: Export and Bulk Operations

## Description
Implement comprehensive export functionality and bulk operations for matter management, enabling users to export case data in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF) and perform bulk updates on multiple matters simultaneously. This feature addresses the need for data portability, reporting, and efficient management of large case volumes in law firms.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement multi-format export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF) for matter data
- Create bulk selection mechanism with visual feedback
- Develop bulk update operations for status changes, assignments, and metadata
- Add progress tracking for long-running export and bulk operations
- Ensure proper error handling and partial failure recovery
- Maintain audit trail for all bulk operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can select multiple matters using checkboxes or selection patterns
- [ ] Export functionality supports CSV, Excel (XLSX), and PDF formats
- [ ] Bulk operations include status updates, assignee changes, and tag management
- [ ] Progress indicators show real-time status for operations affecting 10+ items
- [ ] Failed operations provide detailed error reports with retry options
- [ ] Exported files include metadata (export date, user, filters applied)
- [ ] Bulk operations respect user permissions and validation rules
- [ ] Operations are cancelable with proper rollback handling
- [ ] Export templates are customizable for different report types
- [ ] Performance remains responsive for operations on 1000+ matters

## Subtasks
- [x] Create selection management composable with checkbox states
- [x] Implement CSV export utility with proper escaping and encoding
- [x] Develop Excel export with xlsx library integration
- [x] Add PDF generation service with templating support
- [x] Build bulk update API endpoints with transaction support *(Backend already implemented)*
- [x] Create progress tracking component with WebSocket updates
- [x] Implement operation queue management system
- [x] Add export template configuration interface
- [x] Develop batch validation logic for bulk updates *(Backend already implemented)*
- [x] Create audit logging for all bulk operations *(Backend already implemented)*
- [x] Add error recovery and partial success handling *(Backend already implemented)*
- [x] Implement download manager for generated files *(Integrated in progress tracker)*
- [x] Build export preview functionality *(Integrated in template manager)*
- [x] Add filtering and column selection for exports *(Integrated in template manager)*
- [x] Create bulk operation confirmation dialogs *(Integrated in bulk action toolbar)*
- [x] Implement operation history tracking *(Backend already implemented)*
- [x] Add performance optimization for large datasets *(Backend already implemented)*
- [ ] Create unit tests for export utilities
- [ ] Add integration tests for bulk operations
- [ ] Document export formats and bulk operation APIs

## Technical Guidance

### Selection Management
- Use Vue reactive state for tracking selected items
- Implement select all/none/inverse operations
- Maintain selection across pagination and filtering
- Provide visual indicators for selected items count

### Export Implementation
- CSV: Use proper RFC 4180 formatting with BOM for Excel compatibility
- Excel: Leverage SheetJS or similar library for XLSX generation
- PDF: Consider jsPDF or server-side generation for complex layouts
- Support streaming for large datasets to avoid memory issues

### Bulk Operations Architecture
- Queue operations to prevent server overload
- Use database transactions for atomicity
- Implement optimistic locking for concurrent updates
- Provide rollback capability for failed operations

### Progress Tracking
- WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- Show operation progress with estimated time remaining
- Allow background processing with email notification option
- Maintain operation history for audit purposes

### File Download Management
- Generate temporary signed URLs for downloads
- Implement proper Content-Disposition headers
- Support resume capability for large files
- Clean up temporary files after expiration

### Performance Considerations
- Use virtual scrolling for large selection lists
- Implement server-side cursor pagination
- Batch API calls for bulk operations
- Consider worker threads for heavy processing

### Error Handling
- Categorize errors (validation, permission, system)
- Provide actionable error messages
- Support partial success with detailed reports
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

## Implementation Notes
- Leverage existing Kanban store patterns for state management
- Reuse matter query composables for data fetching
- Follow established UI patterns from shadcn-vue components
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for selection interfaces
- Consider accessibility for bulk selection operations
- Integrate with existing permission system
- Support internationalization for export headers
- Maintain consistency with existing modal patterns
- Use existing toast system for operation feedback
- Consider offline support for export queue
