# Sprint: Matter Management UI - Core Legal Case Management Interface (S12)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the comprehensive matter (legal case) management UI including CRUD operations, Kanban board visualization, advanced search/filtering, and client-accessible views.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- **R04 - Matter Listing**: Implement comprehensive matter listing interface with search, filtering, sorting, and pagination
  - Matter list component with data grid
  - Search bar with instant filtering
  - Advanced filter panel (status, lawyer, client, date ranges)
  - Column sorting and customization
  - Pagination with configurable page sizes
  - Quick actions menu for each matter

- **R05 - Matter Details**: Create detailed matter view pages with all case information
  - Matter detail page layout
  - Case information display panels
  - Related documents section
  - Communication history timeline
  - Status tracking widget
  - Activity log viewer
  - SLA monitoring indicators

- **R06 - Kanban Board**: Build visual Kanban board for case progress tracking
  - Drag-and-drop Kanban interface
  - Customizable columns (case statuses)
  - Matter cards with key information
  - Quick edit capabilities
  - Status transition animations
  - Bulk operations support
  - Mobile-responsive Kanban view

- **R07 - Matter CRUD**: Implement create, read, update, delete operations for matters
  - Create matter form with validation
  - Edit matter interface
  - Delete confirmation dialogs
  - Form field validations
  - Auto-save draft functionality
  - Attachment management
  - Client/lawyer assignment interfaces

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- All CRUD operations functional with proper validation
- Kanban board supports drag-and-drop with optimistic updates
- Search and filtering work across all matter fields
- UI components are responsive and accessible
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for matter operations
- Storybook documentation for all components
- Performance: List loads < 1s, Kanban renders < 500ms

## Dependencies
- S05_M01_Backend_Foundation (REST APIs)
- S06_M01_Authentication_RBAC (Permission checks)
- Backend matter management APIs must be available

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Focus on performance for large matter lists (1000+ items)
- Ensure Kanban board works smoothly on touch devices
- Client view should have limited functionality based on permissions
- Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Use optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance
