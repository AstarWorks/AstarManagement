# Task Split: PDF Viewer Integration

## Description
This task has been split into two smaller, more manageable tasks to improve development velocity and reduce complexity. The original comprehensive PDF viewer implementation has been divided based on feature complexity and dependencies.

## Split Tasks

### T06A_S13_Basic_PDF_Viewer.md
**Focus**: Core PDF viewing functionality
**Complexity**: Medium (12h)
**Features**:
- PDF.js integration with Vue 3
- Document rendering and page navigation
- Zoom controls and keyboard shortcuts
- Performance optimization for large documents
- Basic responsive design

### T06B_S13_PDF_Annotations_Mobile.md
**Focus**: Advanced features and mobile experience
**Complexity**: Medium (12h)
**Dependencies**: T06A_S13_Basic_PDF_Viewer
**Features**:
- Annotation system (highlights, notes)
- Mobile touch gestures (pinch, swipe)
- Fullscreen mode with orientation lock
- Mobile-optimized UI controls
- Haptic feedback and safe area support

## Implementation Strategy
1. Complete T06A first to establish stable foundation
2. Build T06B on top of proven basic viewer
3. Allows for incremental delivery and testing
4. Reduces risk and improves maintainability

## Total Effort
- Combined estimated hours: 24h (unchanged)
- Improved parallelization potential
- Better testability with focused scope per task

## Benefits of Task Splitting
- **Reduced Complexity**: Each task focuses on a specific domain
- **Better Testing**: Isolated features can be tested independently
- **Incremental Delivery**: Core functionality available earlier
- **Risk Mitigation**: Smaller scope reduces chance of major issues
- **Team Collaboration**: Tasks can be worked on in parallel

## Migration Notes
- All original technical specifications moved to individual task files
- Dependencies properly maintained between split tasks
- Original acceptance criteria distributed across both tasks
- Implementation timeline remains realistic at 24h total
