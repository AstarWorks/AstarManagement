# T10_S13: Dynamic Form Builder - Form Generation for Template Variables (SPLIT INTO SUB-TASKS)

**Status**: SPLIT
**Priority**: High
**Complexity**: High (split into manageable tasks)
**Estimated Hours**: 16-20 (total across sub-tasks)

## Overview

⚠️ **TASK SPLIT NOTICE**: This high-complexity task has been broken down into three manageable sub-tasks for better development workflow and reduced risk:

### Sub-Tasks:
1. **T10A_S13_Field_Type_Detection.md** (Low Complexity, 4-6 hours)
   - Template variable parsing and field type detection
   - Foundational component for the entire system

2. **T10B_S13_Dynamic_Form_Rendering.md** (Medium Complexity, 6-8 hours)  
   - Dynamic component rendering and form assembly
   - VeeValidate integration and layout management

3. **T10C_S13_Conditional_Logic_Validation.md** (Medium Complexity, 6-8 hours)
   - Conditional field logic and dynamic validation
   - Data pre-filling and advanced form state management

### Development Sequence:
The sub-tasks should be completed in order: **T10A → T10B → T10C**

### Original Requirements Summary

This system implements a dynamic form builder that can generate forms from document template variables. The complete system will:
- Automatically detect field types from template variables
- Handle conditional logic and field dependencies  
- Apply dynamic validation rules with Zod schema generation
- Pre-fill data from matter/client records
- Integrate seamlessly with existing VeeValidate infrastructure

## Sub-Task Distribution

### T10A_S13_Field_Type_Detection (Foundation)
**Complexity**: Low | **Hours**: 4-6

Core responsibilities:
- Template variable parsing from document content
- Automatic field type detection using pattern matching
- Label and placeholder generation
- Basic field metadata extraction
- Foundation for all subsequent tasks

### T10B_S13_Dynamic_Form_Rendering (Rendering)  
**Complexity**: Medium | **Hours**: 6-8

Core responsibilities:
- Dynamic Vue component resolution and mapping
- Form layout generation and responsive design
- VeeValidate integration for basic validation
- Two-way data binding and form submission
- Integration with existing form component library

### T10C_S13_Conditional_Logic_Validation (Advanced Logic)
**Complexity**: Medium | **Hours**: 6-8

Core responsibilities:
- Complex conditional field logic (show/hide/enable/disable)
- Dynamic Zod schema generation for validation
- Data pre-filling from external sources (matter/client records)
- Advanced form state management (auto-save, undo/redo)
- Field dependency management and cascade updates

## Task Dependencies and Integration

T10B_S13_Dynamic_Form_Rendering (Rendering)
    ↓  
T10C_S13_Conditional_Logic_Validation (Advanced Logic)
```

### Shared Interfaces
All sub-tasks will share common TypeScript interfaces defined in T10A:

```typescript
interface TemplateVariable {
  name: string
  path: string[]
  type: FieldType
  label: string
  placeholder?: string
  required?: boolean
  conditions?: FieldCondition[]
  validation?: ValidationRule[]
  dataSource?: string
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
}

interface FieldType {
  base: 'text' | 'number' | 'date' | 'select' | 'checkbox' | 'radio' | 'email' | 'phone' | 'custom'
  variant?: string
  format?: string
}
```

### Integration Architecture
```
T10A: Template Parser → TemplateVariable[]
    ↓
T10B: Form Renderer → Vue Components + VeeValidate
    ↓
T10C: Logic Engine → Conditional Behavior + Validation
```

## Implementation Coordination

### Development Workflow

1. **Start with T10A_S13_Field_Type_Detection**
   - Establish core interfaces and types
   - Implement template parsing foundation
   - Create shared TypeScript definitions
   - **Output**: `TemplateVariable[]` interface and parsing utilities

2. **Proceed to T10B_S13_Dynamic_Form_Rendering**
   - Use T10A output to render dynamic forms
   - Implement component mapping and layout
   - Integrate with VeeValidate for basic validation
   - **Output**: Working dynamic forms with basic functionality

3. **Complete with T10C_S13_Conditional_Logic_Validation**
   - Add conditional logic and advanced validation
   - Implement data pre-filling and state management
   - Integrate all advanced features
   - **Output**: Full-featured dynamic form builder

### Shared Code Organization

### Integration Testing Strategy

After each sub-task completion:
- **T10A Complete**: Test template parsing accuracy
- **T10B Complete**: Test basic form rendering and submission  
- **T10C Complete**: Test full system with complex scenarios
```

## Overall Integration Points

### Cross-Task Integration
Each sub-task integrates with:
- **Existing Form Infrastructure**: All sub-tasks leverage current VeeValidate and form components
- **Template System**: T09_S13_Template_Browser provides templates for T10A parsing
- **Document Generation**: T11_S13_Document_Generation_Engine consumes form data from T10C
- **Data Sources**: T10C integrates with matter/client APIs for pre-filling

### System Dependencies
- VeeValidate for form validation (T10B, T10C)
- Zod for schema validation (T10C)
- Vue 3 dynamic components (T10B)
- Existing form component library (T10B)

## Combined Testing Strategy

### Progressive Testing Approach
- **T10A**: Unit tests for parsing and type detection
- **T10B**: Integration tests for form rendering + T10A output
- **T10C**: End-to-end tests for complete system functionality

### Performance Targets (Combined)
- Template parsing: < 10ms for 100 variables (T10A)
- Form rendering: < 100ms for 50 fields (T10B)  
- Condition evaluation: < 5ms per field update (T10C)
- **Overall**: Complete form generation < 200ms

### Security Across All Tasks
- T10A: Sanitize parsed template content
- T10B: Validate component props and render safety
- T10C: Secure data pre-filling and validation bypass prevention

## Combined Acceptance Criteria

### Foundation (T10A Complete)
1. [ ] Template variable parsing with 100% accuracy
2. [ ] Field type detection with 90%+ accuracy
3. [ ] Shared interfaces established

### Basic System (T10A + T10B Complete)  
4. [ ] Dynamic form rendering from parsed variables
5. [ ] VeeValidate integration working
6. [ ] Responsive form layouts

### Complete System (All Tasks Complete)
7. [ ] Complex conditional logic support
8. [ ] Data pre-filling from multiple sources
9. [ ] Auto-save and undo/redo functionality
10. [ ] Performance targets met
11. [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)

## Related Tasks

### Direct Dependencies
- **T09_S13_Template_Browser**: Provides templates for parsing
- **T11_S13_Document_Generation_Engine**: Consumes form output

### Indirect Dependencies  
- All existing form infrastructure tasks
- VeeValidate setup and configuration
- Component library maintenance

## Migration Strategy

This split approach enables:
1. **Incremental Development**: Each task delivers working functionality
2. **Risk Reduction**: Issues isolated to specific sub-tasks
3. **Parallel Work**: After T10A, T10B and T10C can be developed in parallel if needed
4. **Testing Integration**: Progressive testing ensures system coherence

## Success Metrics

- **Development Velocity**: Faster completion through focused sub-tasks
- **Code Quality**: Better testing and review for smaller components  
- **Maintainability**: Clearer separation of concerns
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different aspects
