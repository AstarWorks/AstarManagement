# Task: Spring Boot Project Setup with Kotlin and Java 21

## Description
Initialize and configure the Spring Boot 3.5.0 project infrastructure for the Aster Management backend. This task establishes the foundational project structure with Kotlin as the primary language, leveraging Java 21 runtime features and Spring Boot's latest capabilities. The setup follows the existing patterns in the backend codebase while ensuring proper modularization for future Spring Modulith integration.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a robust Spring Boot foundation that supports:
- Gradle-based build configuration with Kotlin DSL
- Spring Boot 3.5.0 with proper dependency management
- Kotlin language integration with Spring-specific plugins
- Base application structure following domain-driven design principles
- Development and production profiles configuration
- Essential Spring Boot starters for web, security, and data access

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Gradle build configuration properly set up with Kotlin DSL syntax
- [ ] Spring Boot 3.5.0 parent dependency correctly configured
- [ ] Kotlin plugins integrated (spring, jpa, all-open)
- [ ] Java 21 toolchain properly configured
- [ ] Application properties structured for multiple environments
- [ ] Base package structure follows DDD principles
- [ ] Application runs successfully with embedded server
- [ ] Build produces executable JAR artifact

## Subtasks
- [ ] Configure Gradle build with Kotlin DSL
  - Set up plugins block with Spring Boot and Kotlin versions
  - Configure dependency management plugin
  - Define Java toolchain for version 21
  - Set up repository configurations
  
- [ ] Set up Spring Boot dependencies
  - Add core starters (web, actuator, validation)
  - Include data access starters (JPA, Redis)
  - Configure security starter for OAuth2
  - Add development tools dependency
  
- [ ] Configure Kotlin integration
  - Apply kotlin-spring plugin for proper proxy generation
  - Configure kotlin-jpa plugin for entity classes
  - Add Jackson Kotlin module for JSON serialization
  - Include Kotlin reflection and stdlib dependencies
  
- [ ] Create base application structure
  - Main application class with @SpringBootApplication
  - Package structure: config, controller, domain, dto, service, repository
  - Application properties for different profiles
  - Logging configuration with appropriate levels

## Technical Guidance
Reference the existing backend structure at `/backend/` for patterns:
- Build configuration in `build.gradle.kts` shows plugin versions and dependency structure
- Application class in `src/main/kotlin/dev/ryuzu/astermanagement/`
- Properties files demonstrate multi-environment configuration approach
- Package organization follows clear separation of concerns

Ensure compatibility with:
- PostgreSQL database integration via Spring Data JPA
- Redis for caching and session management
- Flyway for database migrations
- Spring Security with JWT authentication
- OpenAPI documentation generation

## Implementation Notes
- Leverage Spring Boot's auto-configuration capabilities
- Use constructor injection pattern throughout
- Apply Kotlin idioms (data classes, null safety, extension functions)
- Configure proper logging levels for development vs production
- Set up health check endpoints via Spring Actuator
- Prepare for future Spring Modulith modularization
