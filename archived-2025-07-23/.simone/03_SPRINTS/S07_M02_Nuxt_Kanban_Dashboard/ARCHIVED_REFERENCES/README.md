# S07 Consolidated Reference Archive

This directory contains archived reference implementations that were consolidated during the S07 sprint organization process.

## Archive Contents

### T06_S07_Real_Time_Updates_ARCHITECTURAL_REFERENCE.md
- **Source**: S07_M02_Data_Layer_and_State_Management sprint directory
- **Content**: Comprehensive architectural planning for real-time updates (855 lines)
- **Status**: Incomplete implementation but superior architectural patterns
- **Value**: Reference for future enhancements to the production implementation
- **Key Features**: 
  - Advanced transport abstraction layer
  - Network quality monitoring
  - Activity-based polling intervals
  - Conflict resolution patterns

### T08_S07_SSR_Optimization_PLANNING_REFERENCE.md  
- **Source**: S07_M02_Kanban_System_Implementation sprint directory
- **Content**: Detailed planning and requirements for SSR optimization (522 lines)
- **Status**: Planning phase documentation
- **Value**: Enhancement roadmap for the completed Grade A implementation
- **Key Features**:
  - Virtual scrolling for large datasets
  - Streaming SSR patterns
  - Device capability detection
  - Progressive enhancement strategies

## Usage Notes

- **Primary implementations** remain in the main sprint directory
- **Reference implementations** archived here contain valuable architectural insights
- **Future enhancements** should reference these documents for advanced patterns
- **Do not delete** - these contain production-quality implementation strategies

## Consolidation History

- **Date**: 2025-07-01
- **Reason**: Resolved duplicate Task IDs (T06_S07, T08_S07) across sprint directories
- **Strategy**: Keep production-ready implementations, archive architectural references
- **Result**: Clean namespace with preserved valuable content

## Integration Strategy

Both archived implementations contain strategies that can enhance the main implementations:

### For T06_S07 Enhancement:
1. Integrate network quality monitoring from architectural reference
2. Add transport abstraction layer for future WebSocket migration
3. Implement activity-based polling intervals

### For T08_S07 Enhancement:  
1. Add virtual scrolling for large datasets from planning reference
2. Implement streaming SSR patterns for progressive loading
3. Integrate device capability detection for adaptive performance
