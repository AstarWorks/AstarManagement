## Overview
Create timeline components to visualize the comprehensive audit logging system with expandable details and user attribution

## Background
Based on the analysis:
- Backend has comprehensive audit logging (TX07_S01)
- Audit includes all CRUD operations and status changes
- Need timeline UI component
- Must show user, timestamp, and changes

## Objectives
1. Create timeline UI component
2. Implement audit history API endpoint
3. Add filtering by event type
4. Show before/after values for changes
5. Add export functionality

## Technical Guidance
- Backend audit tables are in the database schema
- Create new component in `/frontend/src/components/audit/`
- Use shadcn/ui timeline or custom component
- Consider virtualization for long audit trails
- Add icons for different event types

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Timeline loads quickly even with 1000+ events
- [x] Events are grouped by day
- [x] User can filter by event type
- [x] Details expand on click
- [x] Export to CSV works

## Implementation Plan
1. **API Development**
   - Create audit history endpoint with pagination
   - Add filtering parameters (date range, event type, user)
   - Implement CSV export endpoint

2. **Frontend Components**
   - Timeline component with virtualization
   - Event type icons and color coding
   - Expandable detail cards
   - Filter controls

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
   - Add proper indexing on audit tables
   - Use cursor-based pagination

4. **User Experience**
   - Group events by day with sticky headers
   - Show relative timestamps
   - Highlight important changes
   - Smooth expand/collapse animations

## Complexity
Medium

## References
- Audit logging implementation from S01 tasks (TX07_S01)
- Database schema for audit tables
- shadcn/ui documentation for timeline components

## Notes
- Consider using React Virtual or similar for performance
- Ensure audit data is properly sanitized before display
- Add proper error handling for failed audit log fetches
- Consider adding real-time updates via WebSocket for live audit trail
