# Task: Performance Optimization and Caching

## Description
Optimize API calls, implement caching strategies, and ensure sub-2-second page loads with 100 matters. This task focuses on meeting performance SLOs and providing a snappy user experience even with large datasets.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement Redis caching for API responses
- Add pagination for large matter lists
- Optimize bundle size and code splitting
- Implement image and avatar optimization
- Achieve < 2 second load time with 100 matters

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Initial page load < 2 seconds with 100 matters
- [ ] API response caching reduces server load by 50%
- [ ] Bundle size < 200KB for initial load
- [ ] Images load progressively with placeholders
- [ ] Pagination works smoothly for large datasets
- [ ] Memory usage stays stable during long sessions
- [ ] Performance metrics are tracked
- [ ] Works well on 3G connections

## Subtasks
- [x] Implement Redis caching layer
- [x] Add pagination to matter lists
- [x] Set up code splitting for routes
- [x] Optimize images and avatars
- [x] Implement request deduplication
- [x] Add performance monitoring
- [x] Optimize Zustand store updates
- [x] Profile and fix memory leaks

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- **Caching**: Implement in `/backend/src/main/kotlin/com/astermanagement/api/config/CacheConfig.kt`
- **Pagination**: Update `/frontend/src/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx`
- **Code Splitting**: Configure in Next.js app router
- **Monitoring**: Add performance marks

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
// Frontend optimization
/frontend/next.config.js (bundle optimization)
/frontend/src/lib/api/cache.ts (request caching)
/frontend/src/components/kanban/VirtualizedBoard.tsx (virtual scrolling)

// Backend caching
/backend/src/main/kotlin/com/astermanagement/api/service/CacheService.kt
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement Zustand selectors properly
- Use Next.js Image component
- Follow existing pagination patterns

### Performance Targets
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  initialLoad: number;      // < 2000ms
  apiResponse: number;      // < 200ms p95
  interactionDelay: number; // < 100ms
  bundleSize: number;       // < 200KB
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Profile current performance baseline
2. Implement Redis caching for GET requests
3. Add pagination to matter endpoint
4. Set up code splitting
5. Optimize images with Next.js Image
6. Implement virtual scrolling
7. Add request deduplication
8. Monitor and iterate

### Key Architectural Decisions to Respect
- Cache invalidation must be correct
- Maintain data consistency
- Support offline mode
- Keep caching transparent

### Testing Approach
- Load test with 1000+ matters
- Test cache invalidation
- Profile with Chrome DevTools
- Test on slow 3G
- Monitor memory usage
- Verify metric tracking

### Performance Considerations
- Use ETags for conditional requests
- Implement infinite scroll carefully
- Compress API responses
- Minimize re-renders

## Output Log
[2025-06-18 14:39]: ✅ Implemented Redis caching layer - Added CacheConfig.kt with Redis configuration, cache regions with different TTLs, and caching annotations to MatterServiceImpl for API response caching
