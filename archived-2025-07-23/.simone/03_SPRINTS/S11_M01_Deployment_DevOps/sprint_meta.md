# Sprint: Deployment & DevOps - Production-ready Infrastructure (S11)

## Sprint Goal
Establish production-ready deployment pipeline with CI/CD, containerization, monitoring, and support for both cloud (GKE) and on-premise (k3s) environments

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Docker containerization for all services
- Kubernetes manifests for GKE and k3s
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- ArgoCD GitOps configuration
- Terraform infrastructure as code
- Prometheus monitoring setup
- Grafana dashboards for key metrics
- Automated backup strategies
- SSL/TLS certificate management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Load testing and performance optimization

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Application deploys successfully to both GKE and k3s
- CI/CD pipeline runs all tests and deploys on merge
- Monitoring alerts are configured for critical metrics
- Backup and restore procedures are tested
- Performance meets defined SLAs (p95 < 200ms)
- Security scanning passes without critical issues
- Documentation covers deployment procedures

## Dependencies
- All previous sprints (complete application required)
- S05_M01_Backend_Foundation (for Spring Actuator metrics)
- S10_M01_OCR_AI_Integration (for external service configs)

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Ensure secrets management is properly configured
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Plan for disaster recovery scenarios
