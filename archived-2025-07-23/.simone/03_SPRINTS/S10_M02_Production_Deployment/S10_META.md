# Sprint S10: Production Deployment and Cutover

## Overview

This sprint focuses on the production deployment of the Nuxt.js frontend, including infrastructure setup, deployment automation, monitoring configuration, and the cutover strategy from the existing Next.js application.

## Sprint Goal

Successfully deploy the Nuxt.js frontend to production with zero downtime, comprehensive monitoring, and a safe rollback strategy, while completing the migration from Next.js.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

- Production infrastructure setup for Nuxt.js
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Performance optimization for production
- Feature flag implementation for gradual rollout
- Rollback procedures and testing
- Team training and handover

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

- [ ] Production infrastructure provisioned and tested
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploying successfully
- [ ] Blue-green deployment working with zero downtime
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
- [ ] Performance targets met in production
- [ ] Feature flags controlling access
- [ ] Rollback tested and documented
- [ ] Team trained on new deployment process
- [ ] Next.js application decommissioned
- [ ] Post-deployment validation complete

## Sprint Tasks

### Infrastructure Setup (High Complexity)

2. **T02_S10_CDN_Configuration.md** (Complexity: Medium - 6 story points)
   - Configure CDN for static assets and edge caching
   - Dependencies: T01_S10

### Deployment Automation (Medium Complexity)
3. **T03_S10_CI_CD_Pipeline.md** (Complexity: Medium - 8 story points)
   - GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
   - Dependencies: T01_S10

4. **T04_S10_Blue_Green_Deployment.md** (Complexity: High - 10 story points)
   - Implement zero-downtime deployment strategy
   - Dependencies: T01_S10, T03_S10

### Monitoring & Observability (Medium Complexity)
5. **T05_S10_Monitoring_Setup.md** (Complexity: Medium - 7 story points)
   - Configure APM, logging, and error tracking
   - Dependencies: T01_S10

6. **T06_S10_Performance_Monitoring.md** (Complexity: Medium - 6 story points)
   - Real User Monitoring (RUM) and performance alerts
   - Dependencies: T05_S10

### Rollout Strategy (Medium Complexity)
7. **T07_S10_Feature_Flags.md** (Complexity: Medium - 7 story points)

   - Dependencies: T04_S10

8. **T08_S10_Rollback_Procedures.md** (Complexity: Medium - 6 story points)
   - Document and test rollback scenarios
   - Dependencies: T04_S10, T07_S10

### Cutover & Training (Low-Medium Complexity)
9. **T09_S10_Migration_Execution.md** (Complexity: Medium - 8 story points)
   - Execute production cutover from Next.js to Nuxt.js
   - Dependencies: All previous tasks

10. **T10_S10_Team_Training.md** (Complexity: Low - 5 story points)
    - Train team on new deployment and monitoring
    - Dependencies: T09_S10

### Total Story Points: 73

## Technical Constraints

- Must support SSR with proper caching
- Zero downtime during deployment
- Maintain all security standards
- Support gradual rollout capabilities
- Compatible with existing infrastructure

## Dependencies

- Completed S09 testing and documentation
- Production environment access
- DevOps team availability
- Monitoring tool licenses
- DNS and CDN configuration access

## Required ADRs

- **ADR-001-S10**: Production Architecture for Nuxt.js
- **ADR-002-S10**: Deployment Strategy Selection
- **ADR-003-S10**: Monitoring and Observability Stack
- **ADR-004-S10**: Feature Flag Implementation
- **ADR-005-S10**: Rollback and Recovery Procedures

## Risk Factors

- Production environment differences
- SSR performance at scale
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Feature flag performance impact
- Team readiness for new stack

## Success Metrics

- Deployment success rate: 100%
- Zero downtime during cutover
- Performance: <2s page load time
- Error rate: <0.1%
- Rollback time: <5 minutes
- Team confidence: High

## Notes

- Conduct deployment rehearsals in staging
- Prepare runbooks for common issues
- Set up war room for cutover day
- Monitor closely for first 48 hours
- Document lessons learned
