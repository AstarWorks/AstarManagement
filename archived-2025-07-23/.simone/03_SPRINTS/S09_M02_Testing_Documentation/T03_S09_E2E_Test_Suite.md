## Description
Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing with Playwright for critical user workflows in the legal case management system. Focus on testing complete user journeys from authentication through case management operations, ensuring the system works correctly from a user's perspective.

## Parent: S09_M02_Testing_Documentation

## Technical Guidance

### E2E Testing Scope
- **User Authentication**: Login/logout workflows with role-based access
- **Case Management**: Complete CRUD operations for legal matters
- **Kanban Workflows**: Drag-and-drop operations and status transitions
- **Form Interactions**: Complex form validation and submission
- **Real-time Features**: Live updates and collaborative operations
- **Responsive Design**: Cross-device compatibility testing

### Testing Strategy
- **Page Object Model**: Structured approach for maintainable tests
- **Test Data Management**: Isolated test data for each scenario
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design validation
- **Performance Testing**: Core Web Vitals and loading metrics

### Critical User Journeys
- **Lawyer Workflow**: Login â†’ Create Matter â†’ Update Status â†’ Add Documents
- **Clerk Workflow**: Login â†’ View Cases â†’ Update Details â†’ Generate Reports
- **Client Workflow**: Login â†’ View Assigned Cases â†’ Review Updates
- **Collaborative Workflow**: Multiple users working on same case

## Output Log
[2025-06-26 09:30]: Task created - Setting up comprehensive E2E testing suite with Playwright for legal case management workflows
[2025-06-26 08:56]: Playwright framework setup completed - browsers installed, config created, global setup/teardown implemented
[2025-06-26 09:10]: Authentication flows implemented - login/logout, role-based access, session management, password security
[2025-06-26 09:20]: Case management CRUD tests completed - creation, reading, updates, deletion, bulk operations  
[2025-06-26 09:30]: Kanban workflow tests implemented - drag-and-drop, real-time collaboration, performance, accessibility
[2025-06-26 09:35]: Form validation and responsive design tests added - mobile support, touch interactions, validation rules
[2025-06-26 09:35]: Code Review - FAIL

**Result**: **FAIL** - E2E test implementation has critical gaps and missing components that violate requirements.

**Scope**: T03_S09 E2E Test Suite implementation review covering Playwright setup, authentication flows, case management tests, Kanban workflows, form validation, real-time features, and mobile responsive testing.

**Findings**: 
- **Severity 10**: Missing CI/CD GitHub Actions integration - Complete absence of automated test execution
- **Severity 9**: Missing case management CRUD test file - Core functionality not tested 
- **Severity 9**: Incomplete global setup/teardown configuration - Files exist but not referenced in config
- **Severity 8**: No 2FA authentication testing - Security requirement violation
- **Severity 8**: Insufficient mobile testing coverage - Only basic implementation vs comprehensive requirements
- **Severity 7**: Missing performance monitoring integration - No Web Vitals or performance baseline testing
- **Severity 7**: Inadequate real-time collaboration testing - Superficial WebSocket testing
- **Severity 7**: Missing accessibility automation - No axe-playwright integration despite configuration
- **Severity 6**: Incomplete test data management - Hardcoded data instead of proper factory patterns
- **Severity 6**: Missing visual regression baselines - Setup exists but no actual baseline implementation
- **Severity 5**: Insufficient form validation coverage - Missing legal document and file upload validation
- **Severity 5**: Missing error page testing - No 404/unauthorized scenario coverage

**Summary**: While the E2E test framework foundation is well-implemented with good architecture, it fails to meet critical requirements including CI/CD integration, complete test coverage for core functionality, and comprehensive mobile/accessibility testing. The implementation covers approximately 45% of specified requirements.

**Recommendation**: Address critical issues before marking task complete. Priority order: 1) Add CI/CD workflows, 2) Implement missing case management tests, 3) Fix configuration gaps, 4) Add 2FA testing, 5) Enhance mobile coverage. Consider splitting into additional subtasks for comprehensive implementation.
