# Sprint S08: TanStack Query Integration for Kanban

## Overview

This sprint focuses on integrating TanStack Query (formerly React Query) into the Nuxt.js Kanban board to provide robust server state management, optimistic updates, background refetching, and improved data synchronization capabilities.

## Sprint Goal

Replace client-side state management with TanStack Query for all Kanban data operations, providing better caching, synchronization, and real-time update capabilities while maintaining the existing user experience.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

- TanStack Query setup and configuration for Nuxt 3
- Query and mutation hooks for all Matter operations
- Optimistic updates for drag-and-drop operations
- Background data synchronization and refetching
- Query invalidation strategies for real-time updates
- Offline support with persistent cache
- DevTools integration for debugging
- Performance optimization with intelligent caching

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

- [ ] TanStack Query installed and configured for Nuxt 3
- [ ] All data fetching migrated from Pinia to TanStack Query
- [ ] Optimistic updates working for all mutations
- [ ] Background refetching keeps data synchronized
- [ ] Query cache properly configured for performance
- [ ] Offline mode functions with cached data
- [ ] DevTools shows query states and cache
- [ ] All existing Kanban features maintain functionality
- [ ] Performance metrics meet or exceed current implementation
- [ ] Documentation updated with new patterns

### Total Story Points: 74

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain compatibility with existing Nuxt 3 SSR
- Preserve all current Kanban functionality
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Integrate with existing TypeScript types
- Support both online and offline scenarios
- Maintain sub-200ms response times

## Dependencies

- Completed S07 Kanban implementation
- Existing Spring Boot API endpoints
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Nuxt 3 plugin system

## Required ADRs

The following Architecture Decision Records should be created:

- **ADR-001-S08**: TanStack Query vs Pinia for Server State
- **ADR-002-S08**: Query Key Structure and Naming Conventions
- **ADR-003-S08**: Optimistic Update Strategies
- **ADR-004-S08**: Cache Persistence Approach
- **ADR-005-S08**: Real-time Sync with Query Invalidation

## Risk Factors

- SSR compatibility with TanStack Query hydration
- Query key management complexity
- Cache invalidation timing with concurrent users
- Bundle size increase from new dependency
- Learning curve for team unfamiliar with TanStack Query

## Success Metrics

- Data fetching performance: <100ms for cached queries
- Bundle size increase: <50KB gzipped
- Cache hit rate: >80% for frequently accessed data
- Real-time sync delay: <2 seconds
- Zero data inconsistency issues

## Notes

- Consider using @peterbud/nuxt-query module for easier integration
- Prepare for future infinite query implementation for large datasets
- Document query key patterns for team consistency
- Plan for gradual migration to avoid breaking changes
