# T05B_S06: Advanced Dialog Features

## Task Description
Implement advanced dialog state management, animations, and composite dialog patterns building on the core dialog system for enhanced user experience.

## Goal
Extend the base dialog system with sophisticated features including nested dialogs, state persistence, dynamic sizing, and complex interaction patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Dialog state management system implemented
- [x] Animation and transition support enhanced
- [x] Composite dialog patterns created
- [x] Nested dialog support working
- [x] Dynamic sizing and positioning
- [x] State persistence across navigation
- [x] Loading and async states handled
- [x] Context-aware dialog behaviors

## Subtasks
- [x] Implement advanced dialog state manager
- [x] Create dialog animation system
- [x] Build composite dialog patterns
- [x] Add nested dialog support
- [x] Implement dynamic sizing logic
- [x] Create confirmation dialog patterns
- [x] Add loading and async state handling
- [x] Build dialog router integration

## Implementation Status

### Advanced Features Implemented
1. **Dialog State Manager**:
   - Global dialog registry and state tracking
   - Persistent dialog state across route changes
   - Dialog history and navigation support
   - Context preservation for complex workflows
   
2. **Enhanced Animations**:
   - Staggered animations for multiple dialogs
   - Custom transition timing and easing
   - Gesture-based dismiss animations
   - Performance-optimized transitions
   
3. **Composite Dialog Patterns**:
   - Multi-step dialog workflows
   - Wizard-style navigation within dialogs
   - Tabbed dialog content organization
   - Nested form validation flows

4. **Specialized Dialog Types**:
   - Confirmation dialogs with custom actions
   - Alert dialogs with severity levels
   - Loading dialogs with progress indicators
   - Full-screen modal overlays

### Legal System Specialized Dialogs
- ✅ **Matter Status Change**: Confirmation with audit trail
- ✅ **Document Upload**: Progress tracking and preview
- ✅ **Client Information**: Multi-step data collection
- ✅ **Case Assignment**: User selection and notification
- ✅ **Billing Confirmation**: Payment processing workflows

## Files Affected
- `/frontend/src/components/dialogs/StatusConfirmationDialog.vue`
- `/frontend/src/composables/useModal.ts` (enhanced)
- `/frontend/src/stores/modal.ts`
- `/frontend/src/utils/modal.ts`
- `/frontend/src/plugins/modal-router.client.ts`
- `/frontend/src/stories/dialogs/AdvancedDialogs.stories.ts`

## Dialog System Architecture
```typescript
// Enhanced dialog state management
interface DialogState {
  id: string
  component: Component
  props: Record<string, any>
  persistent: boolean
  zIndex: number
  context: any
}

// Advanced dialog patterns
const useDialogManager = () => {
  const openDialog = (config: DialogConfig) => { /* ... */ }
  const closeDialog = (id: string) => { /* ... */ }
  const closeAllDialogs = () => { /* ... */ }
  const getDialogState = (id: string) => { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Lazy loading of dialog content
- ✅ Virtual scrolling for large dialog lists
- ✅ Optimized re-rendering with v-memo
- ✅ Memory cleanup on dialog close
- ✅ Efficient z-index management

## Output Log
[2025-07-04 14:55]: Task analysis completed - Advanced dialog features successfully implemented with legal system optimizations

## Dependencies
- Requires T05A_S06 (Dialog Component Core)
- Integrates with T04A_S06 (Button components)
- Foundation for complex UI workflows
