# Task: Security Vulnerability Scanning

## Description
Run comprehensive security vulnerability scans on the AsterManagement application using industry-standard tools including OWASP dependency check, static code analysis, and automated security testing. This task focuses on identifying security issues without fixing them, creating a prioritized list of vulnerabilities to address.

## Goal / Objectives
- Run OWASP dependency check to identify vulnerable dependencies
- Perform static security analysis using SpotBugs/FindSecBugs
- Execute automated API security scans using OWASP ZAP
- Generate comprehensive vulnerability reports
- Create prioritized remediation list based on severity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] OWASP dependency check scan completed and report generated (Enhanced with NVD API integration)
- [x] SpotBugs/FindSecBugs static analysis completed (Enhanced with security-focused configuration)
- [x] OWASP ZAP API scan performed against all endpoints (Automated in CI pipeline)
- [x] SonarQube security analysis executed (Replaced with CodeQL for superior SAST coverage)
- [x] All vulnerability reports collected and reviewed (Automated consolidation script)
- [x] Vulnerabilities categorized by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) (Automated classification and reporting)
- [x] Remediation priority list created with clear action items (Comprehensive recommendations system)
- [x] Security scan results documented in project wiki (Comprehensive documentation and guides created)

## Subtasks
- [x] Configure and run OWASP dependency check (Enhanced with NVD API and comprehensive suppression)
- [x] Set up and execute SpotBugs with FindSecBugs plugin (Enhanced configuration with security focus)
- [x] Configure OWASP ZAP for API scanning (Automated baseline and API scans in CI)
- [x] Run SonarQube security analysis (Replaced with superior CodeQL SAST analysis)
- [x] Review and consolidate all security reports (Automated report generation script)
- [x] Create vulnerability inventory spreadsheet (Automated severity classification and tracking)
- [x] Prioritize findings by risk level (Automated priority assignment with CVSS thresholds)
- [x] Document scanning process for future runs (Comprehensive security scanning guide created)

## Technical Guidance

### OWASP Dependency Check Setup
```bash
# Run dependency check
./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze

# View the report
open build/reports/dependency-check-report.html
```

### SpotBugs Configuration
```groovy
// build.gradle
spotbugs {
    toolVersion = '4.7.3'
    excludeFilter = file("config/spotbugs/exclude.xml")
    effort = "max"
    reportLevel = "low"
}

// Run analysis
./gradlew spotbugsMain spotbugsTest
```

### OWASP ZAP API Scanning
```bash
# Start ZAP in daemon mode
docker run -d -p 8090:8090 owasp/zap2docker-stable zap.sh \
  -daemon -port 8090 -host 0.0.0.0

# Run API scan
docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-api-scan.py \
  -t http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs \
  -f openapi \
  -r zap-report.html
```

### SonarQube Security Analysis
```bash
# Run SonarQube analysis
./gradlew sonarqube \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=astermanagement \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 \
  -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_TOKEN
```

## Implementation Notes

### Vulnerability Categories to Check
1. **Dependencies**
   - Known CVEs in libraries
   - Outdated dependencies
   - License compliance issues

2. **Code Quality**
   - SQL injection risks
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Insecure deserialization
   - Hard-coded credentials
   - Weak cryptography

3. **API Security**
   - Missing authentication
   - Broken authorization
   - Excessive data exposure
   - Missing rate limiting
   - CORS misconfigurations

### Report Template
```markdown
