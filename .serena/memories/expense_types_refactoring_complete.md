# Expense Types Refactoring Complete

## Summary
Successfully consolidated duplicate type definitions in the expense module.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Removed Duplicate Definitions
- Deleted monolithic `/modules/expense/types/expense.ts` (821 lines)
- Kept modular structure in `/modules/expense/types/expense/` directory

### 2. Consolidated Types
- **expense.ts**: Core expense interfaces (IExpense, IExpenseFilters, etc.)
- **tag.ts**: Tag-related types with proper TypeScript enums
- **attachment.ts**: Attachment types with proper enums
- **api.ts**: API request/response types
- **index.ts**: Central barrel export file

### 3. Fixed Inconsistencies
- Merged IExpenseFilters and IExpenseFilter into single comprehensive interface
- Standardized enums (TagScope, AttachmentStatus) using TypeScript enum syntax
- Added type guards and helper functions

### 4. Updated Imports
- Changed from `@expense/types/expense` to relative paths (`../../types/expense`)
- Updated tsconfig.json with new module paths
- Fixed all component and composable imports

## Key Improvements:
- Single source of truth for each type
- Clear module boundaries
- Consistent enum definitions
- Better TypeScript support
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved maintainability
