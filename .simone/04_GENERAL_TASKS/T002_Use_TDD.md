### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- Follow the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a default approach.
- Begin by writing tests based on the expected input and output.
- Do not write any implementation code at this stage—only the tests.
- Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected.
- Once test correctness is confirmed, commit the failing tests.
- Then, begin implementing the code to make the tests pass.
- During implementation, do not modify the tests—focus solely on fixing the code.
- Repeat this process until all tests pass.
