# Task: Nuxt WebSocket Implementation - Activate Real-Time Updates

## Description
The Nuxt.js POC has a comprehensive WebSocket infrastructure prepared but currently operates in polling mode. This task involves activating the WebSocket connection to the Spring Boot backend, implementing proper authentication, handling reconnection scenarios, and ensuring real-time updates work seamlessly across the application. The composables and stores are already WebSocket-ready.

## Goal / Objectives
- Connect WebSocket composable to Spring Boot WebSocket endpoint
- Implement WebSocket authentication with JWT tokens
- Enable real-time matter updates across all clients
- Handle connection lifecycle and reconnection scenarios
- Implement presence awareness (active users)
- Ensure graceful fallback to polling when WebSocket fails
- Add comprehensive error handling and user notifications

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket connects successfully to backend endpoint
- [ ] Authentication works with JWT token in connection
- [ ] Real-time updates propagate to all connected clients
- [ ] Reconnection works seamlessly after network interruption
- [ ] Presence indicators show active users correctly
- [ ] Fallback to polling works when WebSocket unavailable
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance degradation
- [ ] Works in both development and production environments
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging
- [ ] User notifications for connection status changes

## Subtasks
- [ ] Configure Spring Boot WebSocket endpoint URL
- [ ] Update WebSocket composable to send auth token
- [ ] Implement WebSocket message protocol with backend
- [ ] Update real-time store to use WebSocket mode
- [ ] Add connection status indicators to UI
- [ ] Implement heartbeat mechanism
- [ ] Handle reconnection with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add WebSocket event handlers for all operations
- [ ] Implement presence tracking
- [ ] Add connection quality monitoring
- [ ] Create WebSocket debugging utilities
- [ ] Add integration tests for WebSocket functionality
- [ ] Document WebSocket protocol and events

## Technical Guidance

### Key Files to Modify
- `/src/composables/useWebSocketConnection.ts` - Main WebSocket logic
- `/src/stores/kanban/real-time.ts` - Enable WebSocket mode
- `/src/config/realtime.ts` - Switch mode from 'polling' to 'websocket'
- `/src/components/status/ConnectionStatus.vue` - Update UI indicators
- `nuxt.config.ts` - Ensure WebSocket URL is configured

### WebSocket Implementation Details
Current implementation in `real-time.ts` (lines 217-264):
- Connection initialization with auth
- Message handling for different event types
- Reconnection logic already implemented
- Event types: matter_updated, matter_created, user_joined, etc.

### Backend Integration Points
Spring Boot WebSocket configuration needed:
- Endpoint: `/ws` (configurable)
- Authentication: JWT token in connection params
- Message format: JSON with event type and payload
- Heartbeat: Every 30 seconds

### Message Protocol
```typescript
interface WebSocketMessage {
  type: 'matter_updated' | 'matter_created' | 'matter_deleted' | 'user_joined' | 'user_left'
  payload: any
  timestamp: string
  userId?: string
}
```

### Testing Approach
- Unit tests for WebSocket composable
- Integration tests with mock WebSocket server
- E2E tests for real-time synchronization
- Load tests for multiple concurrent connections
- Network interruption simulation tests

### Security Considerations
- Validate JWT tokens on connection
- Implement message validation
- Rate limiting for message sending
- Secure WebSocket (WSS) in production

### Performance Optimization
- Implement message batching
- Use compression for large payloads
- Monitor memory usage
- Implement connection pooling if needed
