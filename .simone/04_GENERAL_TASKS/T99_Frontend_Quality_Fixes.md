# T99: Frontend Code Quality Fixes

## Objective
Make lint, lint:check, typecheck, and build pass for the entire frontend codebase to ensure code quality standards are met.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ✅ ESLint passes without errors
- [ ] ✅ TypeScript type checking passes without errors  
- [ ] ✅ Production build completes successfully
- [ ] ✅ No `any` types used
- [ ] ✅ All hardcoded strings replaced with i18n keys

## Technical Details

### Issues Fixed
1. **i18n Violations**: Removed hardcoded Japanese text in ExpensePagination.vue
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed type mismatches in multiple components
3. **ESLint Violations**: Fixed boolean prop shorthand, unused variables, naming conventions
4. **Build Issues**: Resolved all compilation errors

### Components Modified
- ExpensePagination.vue - Complete refactoring into smaller components
- usePagination.ts - New composable with VueUse integration
- Multiple UI components for pagination
- Filter components - Fixed emit type definitions
- VirtualExpenseList.vue - Fixed emit proxy types
- useAsyncData.ts - Renamed function to avoid conflicts
- useExpenseFormatters.ts - Added missing getCategoryBadgeClass function

## Output Log

[2025-08-05 10:30]: Code Review - **PASS**
Result: **PASS** All quality checks are now passing successfully.
**Scope:** Frontend-wide quality assurance for lint, typecheck, and build processes.
**Findings:** 
- Fixed 6 ESLint errors (Severity: 5)
- Fixed 11 TypeScript errors (Severity: 8)
- Fixed 1 critical i18n violation - hardcoded Japanese text (Severity: 10)
- All issues have been resolved

**Summary:** The frontend codebase now meets all quality standards. All automated checks (lint, typecheck, build) pass successfully. The critical i18n violation has been fixed, ensuring proper internationalization support.

**Recommendation:** 
1. Continue to run quality checks before commits
2. Consider adding pre-commit hooks to enforce these standards
3. The pagination refactoring demonstrates good architectural practices that should be applied to other components

[2025-08-14 08:45]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** ESLint errors and code quality issues found.
**Scope:** ExpenseAdditionalInfoStep.vue refactoring - Clean Architecture implementation
**Findings:** 
- Severity 7: ESLint errors - 7 unused variables/imports (formValues, meta, props, isLoading, t) that should be prefixed with underscore
- Severity 7: Interface naming convention violation - ExpenseFormStepConfig should be IExpenseFormStepConfig
- Severity 5: TypeScript warnings - 16 instances of `any` type usage in composables
- Severity 3: Scope deviation - Refactoring was not explicitly requested in task specification, though it improves code quality
**Summary:** While the refactoring successfully implements Clean Architecture principles and improves component structure, it fails ESLint checks with unused variables and naming convention violations. The implementation conforms to architectural requirements but has code quality issues.
**Recommendation:** Fix all ESLint errors by prefixing unused variables with underscore (_formValues, _meta, etc.) and rename interface to follow naming convention. Consider replacing `any` types with specific types. After fixes, the refactoring would be excellent.

[2025-08-14 09:15]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** All four quality checks (lint, lint:check, typecheck, build) failed with critical errors.
**Scope:** Complete frontend code review using lint, lint:check, typecheck, and build processes
**Findings:** 
- Severity 10: Build failure - Missing exports (TagScope, AttachmentStatus) preventing production build
- Severity 10: TypeScript standards violation - 16 instances of `any` type usage (violates CLAUDE.md core principle)
- Severity 8: Multiple TypeScript compilation errors - Missing properties (balance, tags, attachments) on IExpense interface
- Severity 8: Type incompatibility errors in case status assignments
- Severity 6: 7 ESLint errors - Unused variables (formValues, meta, props, isLoading, t, showToast, setLastOperation)
- Severity 6: Interface naming convention violation - ExpenseFormStepConfig should be IExpenseFormStepConfig
- Severity 3: 2 Vue style violations - Boolean prop shorthand
- Severity 3: 4 empty interface warnings
**Summary:** The frontend codebase fails all quality checks with 22 ESLint errors, 16 warnings, multiple TypeScript errors, and build failure. Critical violations include `any` type usage and missing type exports that prevent production deployment.
**Recommendation:** Immediate fixes required: 1) Add missing exports to types/expense.ts, 2) Replace all `any` types with proper TypeScript types, 3) Fix unused variables by prefixing with underscore, 4) Update IExpense interface to include missing properties, 5) Fix case status type assignments. Run quality checks after each fix.
