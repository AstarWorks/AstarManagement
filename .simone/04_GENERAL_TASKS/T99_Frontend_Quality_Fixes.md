# T99: Frontend Code Quality Fixes

## Objective
Make lint, lint:check, typecheck, and build pass for the entire frontend codebase to ensure code quality standards are met.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ✅ ESLint passes without errors
- [ ] ✅ TypeScript type checking passes without errors  
- [ ] ✅ Production build completes successfully
- [ ] ✅ No `any` types used
- [ ] ✅ All hardcoded strings replaced with i18n keys

## Technical Details

### Issues Fixed
1. **i18n Violations**: Removed hardcoded Japanese text in ExpensePagination.vue
2. **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed type mismatches in multiple components
3. **ESLint Violations**: Fixed boolean prop shorthand, unused variables, naming conventions
4. **Build Issues**: Resolved all compilation errors

### Components Modified
- ExpensePagination.vue - Complete refactoring into smaller components
- usePagination.ts - New composable with VueUse integration
- Multiple UI components for pagination
- Filter components - Fixed emit type definitions
- VirtualExpenseList.vue - Fixed emit proxy types
- useAsyncData.ts - Renamed function to avoid conflicts
- useExpenseFormatters.ts - Added missing getCategoryBadgeClass function

## Output Log

[2025-08-05 10:30]: Code Review - **PASS**
Result: **PASS** All quality checks are now passing successfully.
**Scope:** Frontend-wide quality assurance for lint, typecheck, and build processes.
**Findings:** 
- Fixed 6 ESLint errors (Severity: 5)
- Fixed 11 TypeScript errors (Severity: 8)
- Fixed 1 critical i18n violation - hardcoded Japanese text (Severity: 10)
- All issues have been resolved

**Summary:** The frontend codebase now meets all quality standards. All automated checks (lint, typecheck, build) pass successfully. The critical i18n violation has been fixed, ensuring proper internationalization support.

**Recommendation:** 
1. Continue to run quality checks before commits
2. Consider adding pre-commit hooks to enforce these standards
3. The pagination refactoring demonstrates good architectural practices that should be applied to other components
