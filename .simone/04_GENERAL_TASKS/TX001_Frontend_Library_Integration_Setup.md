# Task: Frontend Library Integration Setup

## Description
Integrate essential frontend development libraries (Storybook, Zustand, Lucide-React, and Zod) into the Aster Management project and update documentation to reflect the enhanced frontend architecture. This task establishes the foundation for advanced UI development patterns required for the Kanban board implementation in Sprint S02 and supports the agent-native architecture principle by providing well-documented, type-safe components that AI agents can understand and manipulate.

The integration aligns with the project's core philosophy of "Engineer time is precious - Automate everything possible" by providing robust development tools that will accelerate frontend development phases while maintaining the strict TypeScript standards and modern React patterns already established.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a comprehensive frontend development environment that supports component-driven development, type-safe state management, and comprehensive documentation aligned with the agent-native architecture.

- **Component Development**: Set up Storybook for isolated component development and documentation
- **State Management**: Integrate Zustand for efficient state management in complex UI interactions
- **Type Safety**: Enhance form validation and API integration with Zod schemas
- **Documentation**: Update architecture and frontend documentation to reflect new capabilities
- **Agent-Native Support**: Ensure all components are documented for AI agent consumption

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Storybook is configured and functional with existing shadcn/ui components
- [ ] Zustand is integrated with TypeScript support and example usage patterns
- [ ] Zod schemas are established for form validation and API type safety
- [ ] Lucide-React integration is verified and optimized (already installed)
- [ ] Architecture documentation updated with new library specifications
- [ ] Frontend CLAUDE.md updated with usage patterns and conventions
- [ ] All new dependencies are compatible with Bun package manager
- [ ] Integration works with existing TailwindCSS v4 and dark mode configuration
- [ ] Example components demonstrate proper library usage patterns
- [ ] No conflicts with existing Next.js 15 App Router and React 19 setup

## Subtasks
- [x] Install and configure Storybook with shadcn/ui integration
- [x] Set up Zustand with TypeScript configuration and example store
- [x] Configure Zod with form validation examples and API schema patterns
- [x] Verify Lucide-React optimization and update if needed
- [x] Create example components demonstrating integrated library usage
- [x] Update `.simone/01_PROJECT_DOCS/ARCHITECTURE.md` with library specifications
- [x] Update `frontend/CLAUDE.md` with development patterns and conventions
- [x] Test compatibility with existing build and development processes
- [ ] Document agent-native CLI interfaces for component operations
- [ ] Create Storybook stories for key shadcn/ui components

## Technical Guidance

### Key Integration Points
- **Frontend Structure**: `frontend/src/` with existing shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/`
- **Configuration Files**: 
  - `frontend/package.json` for dependency management
  - `frontend/tailwind.config.ts` for styling integration
  - `frontend/next.config.mjs` for build configuration
  - `frontend/tsconfig.json` for TypeScript settings
- **Existing Patterns**: 
  - shadcn/ui "new-york" style components
  - `cn()` utility function in `src/lib/utils.ts`
  - TailwindCSS v4 with CSS variables and dark mode

### Library-Specific Integration
- **Storybook**: Configure with existing shadcn/ui components, TailwindCSS v4 support, and dark mode
- **Zustand**: Create stores in `src/stores/` directory, integrate with TypeScript strict mode
- **Zod**: Define schemas in `src/lib/schemas/`, integrate with react-hook-form patterns
- **Lucide-React**: Verify v0.513.0 compatibility, optimize icon usage patterns

### Existing Codebase Patterns
- **Component Architecture**: Function components with TypeScript, forwardRef patterns
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS utilities with `class-variance-authority` for variants
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration with modern ES2017 target
- **Package Management**: Bun 1.2.16 with lockfile management

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Integration Approach
1. **Storybook Setup**: Install @storybook/nextjs, configure with existing TailwindCSS, create stories for Button and Input components
2. **Zustand Integration**: Install zustand, create example store for theme/UI state, establish TypeScript patterns
3. **Zod Configuration**: Install zod and @hookform/resolvers, create form schemas, integrate with shadcn/ui form components
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update architecture.md with library specifications, enhance frontend/CLAUDE.md with usage patterns

### Architectural Decisions to Respect
- **Agent-Native Architecture**: All components must have corresponding CLI interfaces and be well-documented
- **Component-Driven Development**: Storybook supports isolated component testing and documentation
- **Type Safety First**: All libraries must integrate with existing strict TypeScript configuration
- **Performance Considerations**: Leverage existing build optimizations with Turbopack and Bun

### Testing Integration Patterns
- **Component Testing**: Use existing React patterns with Storybook interaction testing
- **Store Testing**: Zustand stores with TypeScript support and predictable state patterns
- **Schema Validation**: Zod schemas with comprehensive test coverage for form validation
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure compatibility with Next.js App Router and React 19

[2025-06-15 09:27]: Completed subtask: Set up Zustand with TypeScript configuration and example store - Zustand 5.0.5 installed with UI store and matter store examples in src/stores/
[2025-06-15 09:29]: Completed subtask: Configure Zod with form validation examples and API schema patterns - Zod 3.25.64 installed with comprehensive schemas for matters, forms, and API validation in src/lib/schemas/
[2025-06-15 09:33]: Completed subtask: Verify Lucide-React optimization and update if needed - Updated from 0.513.0 to 0.515.0, verified TypeScript integration, created icon test component
[2025-06-15 09:35]: Completed subtask: Update ARCHITECTURE.md with library specifications - Added comprehensive frontend architecture patterns section documenting Zustand, Storybook, Zod, and Lucide-React integration

[2025-06-15 10:45]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** The implementation contains undocumented business logic deviations from specifications.
**Scope:** Task T001 Frontend Library Integration Setup - Review of all code changes including package.json updates, new store implementations, schema definitions, and documentation updates.
**Findings:** 
- Issue 1: Additional MatterStatus enum values (Severity: 6/10) - The implemented MatterStatus enum in matter-store.ts includes WAITING_COURT_DATE and ON_HOLD statuses that are not explicitly documented in R02_Kanban_Board_UI.md requirements. R02 specifies exact column structure but does not mention these additional statuses.
- All other implementations (Zustand integration, library versions, store patterns, type safety, architecture documentation, file structure) match specifications correctly.
**Summary:** While the library integration is technically sound and follows architectural patterns correctly, the addition of undocumented MatterStatus enum values violates the zero-tolerance policy for specification deviations.
**Recommendation:** Remove the undocumented WAITING_COURT_DATE and ON_HOLD enum values from matter-store.ts, or formally document these statuses in the requirements before proceeding. Consider creating a requirements amendment if these statuses are needed for business logic.

[2025-06-15 10:50]: Code Review Fix Applied
**Fix Applied:** Removed undocumented MatterStatus enum values (WAITING_COURT_DATE and ON_HOLD) from both matter-store.ts and matter-schemas.ts to align with R02 Kanban Board UI specifications. Updated Zod schema comment to reference R02 requirements. TypeScript compilation successful with no errors.
