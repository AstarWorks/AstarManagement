# Task: Nuxt Storybook UI Testing Implementation

## Description
The Nuxt.js POC has a comprehensive Storybook 8.6.14 setup with 14+ component stories, but lacks advanced UI testing capabilities. This task involves implementing interaction testing, component behavior testing, and visual regression testing within the Storybook environment to ensure component reliability and catch UI regressions.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement comprehensive Storybook interaction testing using @storybook/test
- Add component behavior and state testing for all existing stories
- Set up visual regression testing integration with Storybook test runner
- Create interaction tests for complex components (KanbanBoard, forms, dialogs)
- Establish automated UI testing pipeline in CI/CD

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Interaction tests implemented for all 14+ existing component stories
- [ ] Component behavior testing using @storybook/test utilities
- [ ] Visual regression testing integrated with Storybook test runner
- [ ] Complex component interaction tests (drag-drop, forms, modals)
- [ ] Automated UI test execution in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Test coverage reporting for component interactions
- [ ] Documentation for Storybook testing patterns and best practices

## Subtasks
- [ ] Audit existing Storybook stories and identify testing gaps
- [x] Implement interaction tests using @storybook/test for basic components
- [x] Add user interaction testing (clicks, form inputs, state changes)
- [x] Create complex component interaction tests (KanbanBoard drag-drop)
- [x] Set up visual regression testing with test runner
- [x] Configure automated testing in GitHub Actions workflow
- [x] Add test coverage reporting and thresholds  
- [x] Create comprehensive testing documentation
- [x] Update package.json scripts for Storybook testing
- [x] Implement accessibility testing enhancements

## Technical Guidance

### Existing Infrastructure
- Storybook 8.6.14 fully configured and operational
- @storybook/test and @storybook/test-runner already installed
- 14+ component stories implemented for UI components
- Basic accessibility testing with axe-playwright configured

### Key Components to Test
1. **Basic UI Components**
   - Button (click interactions, states)
   - Input/Select (form interactions, validation)
   - Card/Badge (display states, content variations)

2. **Complex Components**
   - KanbanBoard (drag-drop interactions, state updates)
   - Forms (validation, submission, error handling)
   - Dialogs/Modals (open/close, focus management)

3. **Layout Components**
   - Navigation (responsive behavior, active states)
   - Sidebar (collapse/expand interactions)

### Testing Patterns to Implement
```typescript
import { expect, within, userEvent } from '@storybook/test'

export const InteractiveButton = {
  args: { variant: 'default', children: 'Click me' },
  play: async ({ canvasElement }) => {
    const canvas = within(canvasElement)
    const button = canvas.getByRole('button')
    
    await userEvent.click(button)
    await expect(button).toHaveAttribute('aria-pressed', 'true')
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Add Storybook test runner to existing CI pipeline
- Configure visual regression baseline management
- Set up test artifact collection and reporting

## Dependencies
- T07_S06 (Storybook Development Tools Setup) - ✅ COMPLETED
- All component stories must exist - ✅ Available (14+ stories)
