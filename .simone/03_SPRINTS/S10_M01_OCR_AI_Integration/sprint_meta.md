# Sprint: OCR & AI Integration - Document Processing & Intelligent Features (S10)

## Sprint Goal
Integrate Google Vertex AI for OCR processing, implement intelligent document data extraction, and establish AI-powered search and insights capabilities

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Spring AI configuration with Google Vertex AI
- OCR processing pipeline with Spring Batch
- Document queue management with Redis
- AI-based data extraction from legal documents
- Natural language search implementation
- Smart document classification system
- Case outcome prediction models
- Next-action suggestion engine
- pgvector setup for semantic search
- OCR processing status UI in frontend

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Documents are automatically processed with OCR upon upload
- Text extraction accuracy exceeds 95% for typed documents
- Key legal data is automatically extracted and structured
- Natural language queries return relevant results
- Processing status is visible to users in real-time
- Failed OCR jobs can be retried
- AI features respect data privacy requirements

## Dependencies
- S07_M01_Document_Management (for document storage)
- S08_M01_Search_Communication (for search infrastructure)
- S05_M01_Backend_Foundation (for batch processing)

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Implement proper error handling for AI service failures
- Consider cost optimization for AI API calls
- Ensure GDPR compliance for AI data processing
- Plan for offline fallback when AI services are unavailable
