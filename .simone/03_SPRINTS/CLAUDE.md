# =Ë Sprints Directory Structure

This is the active sprints directory for the Aster Management project.

## Directory Organization

### M01 - Matter Management MVP Sprints
- **S01-S04**: Initial development sprints (Backend API, Frontend Kanban, Integration, Testing)
- **S05-S11**: Backend infrastructure sprints (Foundation, Auth, Documents, Search, etc.)
- **S12-S14**: Frontend feature sprints (Matter Management UI, Communication/Documents, Financial)

### M02 - Frontend Framework Migration Sprints
- **S05-S10**: Nuxt.js migration sprints (Foundation, Components, Query Integration, Testing, Deployment)

## Important Notes

1. Sprint IDs can overlap between milestones (e.g., S05_M01 vs S05_M02) as they belong to different milestones
2. This directory (`03_SPRINTS`) is the active sprints directory
3. The `02_SPRINTS` directory has been migrated here and is now empty
4. Always create new sprints in this directory

## Current Focus

Check `.simone/00_PROJECT_MANIFEST.md` for the current sprint and milestone status.
