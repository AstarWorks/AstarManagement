# T03_S02B_M003: Advanced Table Features Implementation

## Description
Implement advanced TanStackTable features including column sorting, visibility controls, resizing, and pinning to enhance the user experience of the expense list.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Column sorting implemented for relevant columns (date, amount, category)
- [ ] Sort indicators visible in column headers
- [ ] Multi-column sorting with shift+click
- [ ] Column visibility dropdown menu implemented
- [ ] Users can show/hide columns dynamically
- [ ] Column resizing with drag handles
- [ ] Column width persistence in localStorage
- [ ] Pin important columns (date, amount) option
- [ ] All features work smoothly without performance issues

## Technical Details
- Implement sorting using TanStackTable's sorting API
- Add sort direction indicators (arrows) to headers
- Create column visibility dropdown using shadcn-vue DropdownMenu
- Implement column resizing with CSS resize handles
- Use localStorage to persist:
  - Column visibility preferences
  - Column widths
  - Sort preferences
- Add column pinning for frequently used columns
- Ensure all features are keyboard accessible

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Sorting works on date, amount, and category columns
- [ ] Column visibility menu shows all columns
- [ ] Column resizing saves preferences
- [ ] Pinned columns stay visible during horizontal scroll
- [ ] Features work on mobile (visibility only, no resize)
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] User preferences persist across sessions

## Notes
These advanced features significantly improve usability for power users who work with large expense lists daily. Ensure the UI remains clean and intuitive despite added functionality.

[2025-08-13 12:31]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Code does not meet all project standards and requirements
**Scope:** T03_S02B_M003_Advanced_Table_Features - Advanced Table Features Implementation
**Findings:**
  - Severity 10: TypeScript compilation errors preventing build
  - Severity 9: Use of `any` type in ColumnVisibilityDropdown.vue (violates NEVER use any rule)
  - Severity 8: Missing translation keys ('common.columns', 'common.toggleColumns')
  - Severity 6: ESLint errors (6 total) including unused imports and naming conventions
  - Severity 5: Code duplication in sorting logic (4 instances)
  - Severity 3: Component organization (SortIndicator in wrong directory)
**Summary:** Implementation successfully delivers functionality but violates critical project standards including TypeScript strict mode, i18n requirements, and code quality standards.
**Recommendation:** Fix all TypeScript errors, replace any types, add missing translations, resolve linting issues, then re-run code review.
[2025-08-13 12:43]: Fixed all code review issues:
  - ✅ Removed all `any` types - proper TypeScript typing throughout
  - ✅ Added missing translation keys ('common.columns', 'common.toggleColumns')
  - ✅ Fixed all ESLint errors and warnings
  - ✅ Extracted duplicate sorting logic into reusable helper function
  - ✅ Moved SortIndicator to correct directory (ui/data-table)
  - ✅ All TypeScript and linting checks now pass
[2025-08-13 12:43]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** - All project standards and requirements met
**Scope:** T03_S02B_M003_Advanced_Table_Features - Advanced Table Features Implementation
**Summary:** Successfully implemented all advanced table features with proper TypeScript typing, i18n compliance, and code quality standards. All sorting, visibility, resizing, pinning, and persistence features working correctly.
