# S02B_M003: TanStackTable Migration and UI Standardization

## Sprint Goal
Refactor existing expense list implementations to use TanStackTable v8 and ensure all UI components consistently use shadcn-vue, eliminating custom table implementations and improving maintainability.

## Key Deliverables
- Replace custom expense list table with TanStackTable implementation
- Integrate shadcn-vue table components with TanStackTable
- Implement advanced table features (sorting, filtering, pagination)
- Add column visibility controls and resizing
- Ensure server-side pagination readiness
- Standardize all form components to use shadcn-vue
- Update loading states to use shadcn-vue skeleton components
- Improve table performance for large datasets

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All expense list views use TanStackTable v8
- [ ] Custom table implementations completely removed
- [ ] Sorting works on all relevant columns
- [ ] Filtering integrates with existing filter UI
- [ ] Pagination controls use TanStackTable state
- [ ] Column visibility toggle implemented
- [ ] Column resizing functional
- [ ] All forms use shadcn-vue components
- [ ] Loading states use shadcn-vue skeletons
- [ ] Performance improved for 1000+ rows
- [ ] TypeScript types properly defined
- [ ] Unit tests updated for new implementation
- [ ] Storybook stories created for table component

## Dependencies
- TanStackTable v8 already installed
- shadcn-vue already integrated
- Completed S02_M003 expense list implementation
- Existing filter and pagination logic

## Tasks
- T01_S02B_M003: TanStackTable Core Setup - Create base table component with TanStackTable integration (4 hours)
- T02_S02B_M003: Expense List Refactoring - Replace custom table with TanStackTable in expense list (6 hours)
- T03_S02B_M003: Advanced Table Features - Implement sorting, column visibility, resizing (4 hours)
- T04_S02B_M003: Filter Integration - Connect existing filters to TanStackTable state (3 hours)
- T05_S02B_M003: Pagination Refactoring - Migrate pagination to TanStackTable controls (3 hours)
- T06_S02B_M003: UI Component Standardization - Replace custom components with shadcn-vue (4 hours)
- T07_S02B_M003: Performance Optimization - Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets (3 hours)
- T08_S02B_M003: Testing and Documentation - Update tests and create Storybook stories (3 hours)

**Total Estimated Hours**: 30 hours (3-4 days)

## Technical Considerations
- Use TanStackTable's Vue adapter (@tanstack/vue-table)
- Implement memoization for computed columns
- Use virtual scrolling for datasets > 100 rows
- Maintain existing filter/search functionality
- Ensure backward compatibility with mock data service
- Follow TanStackTable best practices for performance
- Use shadcn-vue DataTable patterns
- Implement proper TypeScript generics

## Notes
This sprint addresses technical debt from S02_M003 by migrating to industry-standard table implementation. TanStackTable provides better performance, more features, and improved maintainability. This migration sets the foundation for advanced features in S03_M003 like CSV import and bulk operations.
