# T03_S02B_M003: Advanced Table Features Implementation

## Description
Implement advanced TanStackTable features including column sorting, visibility controls, resizing, and pinning to enhance the user experience of the expense list.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Column sorting implemented for relevant columns (date, amount, category)
- [ ] Sort indicators visible in column headers
- [ ] Multi-column sorting with shift+click
- [ ] Column visibility dropdown menu implemented
- [ ] Users can show/hide columns dynamically
- [ ] Column resizing with drag handles
- [ ] Column width persistence in localStorage
- [ ] Pin important columns (date, amount) option
- [ ] All features work smoothly without performance issues

## Technical Details
- Implement sorting using TanStackTable's sorting API

- Implement column resizing with CSS resize handles
- Use localStorage to persist:
  - Column visibility preferences
  - Column widths
  - Sort preferences
- Add column pinning for frequently used columns
- Ensure all features are keyboard accessible

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Sorting works on date, amount, and category columns
- [ ] Column visibility menu shows all columns

- [ ] Pinned columns stay visible during horizontal scroll
- [ ] Features work on mobile (visibility only, no resize)

- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] User preferences persist across sessions

## Notes
These advanced features significantly improve usability for power users who work with large expense lists daily. Ensure the UI remains clean and intuitive despite added functionality.
