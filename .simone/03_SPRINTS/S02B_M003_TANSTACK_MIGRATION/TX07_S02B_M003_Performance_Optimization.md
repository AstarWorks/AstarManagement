# T07_S02B_M003: Performance Optimization

## Description
Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets and optimize table performance for 1000+ rows. This task focuses on memory management, rendering optimization, and performance benchmarking to ensure smooth table interactions with large expense datasets.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Virtual scrolling implemented for datasets > 100 rows
- [ ] Table performance improved for 1000+ rows (< 100ms render time)
- [ ] Memory usage optimized with proper cleanup patterns
- [ ] Performance benchmarks showing measurable improvement
- [ ] Scroll position preservation during data updates
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard in development mode
- [ ] Graceful fallback for non-virtual scrolling mode
- [ ] Row height consistency maintained across virtual items
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works with virtual scrolling
- [ ] Selection state preserved during virtual scrolling

## Technical Details

### Virtual Scrolling Implementation
**Integration Approach:**
- Utilize existing `useVirtualScrolling` composable from `/frontend/app/composables/useVirtualScrolling.ts`
- Add `@tanstack/vue-virtual` as dependency for advanced virtual scrolling
- Implement in `DataTable.vue` component with feature flag control

**Key Components:**
1. **VirtualScrollContainer**: Wrapper for table body with fixed height
2. **VirtualRow**: Individual row component with memoization
3. **PerformanceMonitor**: Development-only performance tracking

### TanStackTable Optimization Patterns
**Memoization Strategy:**
```typescript
// Column definitions memoization
const columns = computed(() => createExpenseColumns(t, formatters, actions))

// Row data memoization with stable references  
const memoizedData = computed(() => 
  props.expenses.map(expense => ({ ...expense }))
)

// Filter functions memoization
const filterFns = {
  dateRangeFilter: markRaw(dateRangeFilter),
  amountRangeFilter: markRaw(amountRangeFilter),
  multiSelectFilter: markRaw(multiSelectFilter),
  fuzzyFilter: markRaw(fuzzyFilter)
}
```

**Performance Patterns from Codebase:**
- Use `markRaw()` for filter functions to prevent reactivity overhead
- Implement debounced filtering (existing 300ms implementation)
- Leverage TanStackTable's built-in row virtualization
- Optimize cell renderers with `shallowRef` for complex components

### Memory Management 
**Cleanup Patterns:**
- Automatic performance monitoring pause/resume based on element visibility
- Throttled scroll handlers (16ms for ~60fps) from existing virtual scrolling composable
- Row selection cleanup on component unmount
- Filter state garbage collection for large datasets

**Memory Optimization:**
- Limit rendered rows to viewport + overscan (configurable)
- Release unused DOM nodes outside viewport
- Implement row recycling for consistent memory usage
- Cache computed values with proper dependency tracking

### Performance Benchmarking
**Metrics to Track:**
1. **Initial Render Time**: < 100ms for 1000+ rows
2. **Scroll Performance**: 60fps during virtual scrolling
3. **Memory Usage**: Stable memory consumption regardless of dataset size
4. **Filter Performance**: < 50ms for complex filter operations
5. **Selection Operations**: < 10ms for bulk selection

**Testing Framework:**
- Extend existing test suite in `/frontend/app/test/expensePaginationIntegration.test.ts`
- Add performance benchmarks for large dataset scenarios
- Implement automated performance regression detection

### Configuration and Feature Flags
**Table Configuration Updates:**
```typescript
// expenseTableConfig.ts updates
export const EXPENSE_TABLE_CONFIG = {
  virtualScrolling: {
    enabled: true,
    threshold: 100, // Enable for datasets > 100 rows
    itemHeight: 60, // Fixed row height for virtual scrolling
    overscan: 5,    // Extra rows to render outside viewport
    showPerformanceMetrics: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
  },
  performance: {
    enableMemoization: true,
    debounceMs: 300,
    throttleScrollMs: 16
  }
}
```

   - Add automatic cleanup for selection state
   - Optimize re-render patterns for data updates

### Phase 3: Benchmarking and Monitoring (0.5 hours)

   - Implement automated performance benchmarks
   - Add development-mode performance monitoring

2. **Documentation and Configuration:**

   - Document virtual scrolling best practices

## Performance Targets

### Before Optimization (Current State)
- **1000 rows**: ~200-300ms initial render
- **Memory usage**: Linear growth with dataset size
- **Scroll performance**: Potential jank with large datasets
- **Filter operations**: ~100-150ms for complex filters

### After Optimization (Target State)
- **1000 rows**: < 100ms initial render (50% improvement)
- **Memory usage**: Stable regardless of dataset size
- **Scroll performance**: Consistent 60fps
- **Filter operations**: < 50ms for complex filters (50% improvement)

## Technical Research Notes

### Existing Codebase Patterns
**Virtual Scrolling Composable**: Already implemented in `/frontend/app/composables/useVirtualScrolling.ts` with:
- Throttled scroll handling (16ms for 60fps)
- Performance monitoring with FPS tracking
- Keyboard navigation support
- Element visibility optimization
- Proper lifecycle management

**Performance Testing**: Existing test infrastructure in:
- `/frontend/app/test/expensePaginationIntegration.test.ts` - 1000 row performance tests
- `/frontend/app/test/expenseFiltering.test.ts` - 10k item filtering performance

**TanStackTable Integration**: Current implementation uses:
- Memoized column definitions in `createExpenseColumns()`
- Optimized filter functions with proper TypeScript typing
- Row selection with proper state management
- Column visibility and resizing capabilities

### Dependencies Required
- `@tanstack/vue-virtual`: For advanced virtual scrolling integration
- Existing composables and utilities already provide necessary foundation

## Notes
This optimization builds upon existing performance patterns in the codebase while introducing virtual scrolling for large datasets. The implementation maintains full backward compatibility and provides configurable performance settings for different use cases.

Priority is given to measurable performance improvements while preserving all existing functionality including filtering, sorting, row selection, and mobile responsiveness.
