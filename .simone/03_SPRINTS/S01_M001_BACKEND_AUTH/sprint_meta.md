# Sprint S01: Backend Authentication Infrastructure

## Sprint Goal
Implement the complete backend authentication system using Spring Security with JWT tokens, providing secure API endpoints for user authentication and authorization.

## Sprint Scope

### High-Level Deliverables
- [ ] Spring Security configuration with JWT authentication
- [ ] User authentication API endpoints (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/refresh, /api/auth/logout)
- [ ] User management system (User entity, repository, service, controller)
- [ ] Basic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system
- [ ] PostgreSQL database schema for authentication
- [ ] Password hashing and security measures
- [ ] Basic audit logging for authentication events

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Spring Security Setup** (AUTH-001)
   - SecurityConfig class with JWT filter chain
   - JWT authentication entry point and access denied handler
   - API endpoint protection configuration

2. **JWT Authentication Endpoints** (AUTH-002)
   - POST /api/auth/login - User authentication with email/password
   - POST /api/auth/refresh - Token refresh mechanism
   - POST /api/auth/logout - Session invalidation
   - JWTService for token generation and validation

3. **User Management API** (AUTH-003)
   - User entity with proper validation and security
   - UserRepository with custom queries
   - UserService with business logic
   - UserController with REST endpoints
   - CRUD operations for user management

4. **RBAC Foundation** (AUTH-004)
   - Role and Permission entities
   - Basic permission hierarchy (lawyer > clerk > client)
   - @PreAuthorize annotations on controllers
   - Permission checking mechanisms

## Task Breakdown

This sprint has been broken down into 7 detailed implementation tasks with comprehensive technical guidance:

### Core Infrastructure Tasks (16 hours)
- **[T01_S01_Spring_Security_Configuration](T01_S01_Spring_Security_Configuration.md)** (8 hours)
  - Spring Security 6.x configuration with JWT filter chain
  - CORS setup for frontend integration
  - Custom authentication entry points and error handling

- **[T02_S01_JWT_Service_Implementation](T02_S01_JWT_Service_Implementation.md)** (6 hours)
  - JWT token generation and validation service
  - Refresh token management with database persistence
  - Claims-based user information storage

### API & Business Logic Tasks (22 hours)
- **[T03_S01_Authentication_API_Endpoints](T03_S01_Authentication_API_Endpoints.md)** (8 hours)
  - REST endpoints for login, logout, refresh, and user profile
  - Comprehensive input validation and error handling
  - OpenAPI documentation integration

- **[T04_S01_User_Entity_Repository_Layer](T04_S01_User_Entity_Repository_Layer.md)** (6 hours)
  - JPA entities with audit trail support
  - Multi-tenant repository implementation
  - Custom UserDetailsService integration

- **[T05_S01_User_Service_Business_Logic](T05_S01_User_Service_Business_Logic.md)** (8 hours)
  - Application service layer with business logic
  - CQRS pattern implementation with commands and queries
  - Password validation and user management workflows

### Security & Testing Tasks (16 hours)
- **[T06_S01_RBAC_System_Implementation](T06_S01_RBAC_System_Implementation.md)** (10 hours)
  - Role-based access control with legal practice hierarchy
  - Permission evaluation service with caching
  - Spring Security method-level security integration

- **[T07_S01_Security_Integration_Testing](T07_S01_Security_Integration_Testing.md)** (8 hours)
  - End-to-end authentication flow testing
  - Security vulnerability testing (OWASP Top 10)
  - Performance testing and compliance validation

**Total Estimated Effort**: 54 hours (7 tasks Ã— 6-10 hours each)
**Sprint Duration**: 5 days (approximately 10-11 hours per day)

## Definition of Done

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] All Spring Boot application starts without errors
- [ ] PostgreSQL database schema created and migrated
- [ ] JWT tokens properly generated and validated
- [ ] Password hashing implemented with bcrypt
- [ ] API endpoints return correct HTTP status codes
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all auth endpoints

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Passwords stored as bcrypt hashes (never plaintext)
- [ ] JWT tokens have proper expiration times
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced in configuration
- [ ] Input validation prevents SQL injection
- [ ] Audit logging captures authentication events

### Code Quality
- [ ] Kotlin code passes ktlint formatting checks
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >80% coverage for auth services
- [ ] Integration tests cover all API endpoints
- [ ] API documentation generated via SpringDoc OpenAPI
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful messages

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- PostgreSQL 15 database running and accessible
- Redis for session/token storage (optional but recommended)
- Spring Security 6.x dependencies configured
- JWT library (jjwt) added to build.gradle.kts

### Data Dependencies
- Database schema design (will be created in this sprint)
- Initial admin user data for testing

## Risks and Mitigations

### High Risk
- **JWT Implementation Complexity**: Use proven Spring Security patterns and well-tested libraries
- **Database Schema Changes**: Design schema carefully upfront, use Flyway for migrations

### Medium Risk
- **Performance of Password Hashing**: Use appropriate bcrypt cost factor (12)
- **Token Storage Strategy**: Implement proper token invalidation mechanisms

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- [ ] User can authenticate with valid credentials
- [ ] Invalid credentials are properly rejected
- [ ] JWT tokens work for accessing protected endpoints
- [ ] Different user roles have appropriate access levels

### Performance Metrics
- [ ] Authentication endpoint responds within 200ms
- [ ] Database queries execute efficiently
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under load

### Security Metrics
- [ ] No passwords stored in plaintext
- [ ] Audit trail captures all authentication attempts
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in error messages
