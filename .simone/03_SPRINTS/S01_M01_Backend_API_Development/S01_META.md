# Sprint: Backend API Development (S01)

## Sprint Goal
Implement the core backend infrastructure for matter management including database schema, entity models, and REST API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Database schema creation (matters and matter_status_history tables)
- Matter entity with JPA mappings and validation
- REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on matters
- Status transition validation logic
- Integration with Spring Security for role-based access control
- Basic audit logging for all matter changes
- Unit tests for service layer (>90% coverage)
- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] Database migrations created and tested
- [ ] All CRUD endpoints functional and returning proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Authentication/authorization working for all endpoints
- [ ] Status transitions validated according to business rules
- [ ] All endpoints documented in OpenAPI specification
- [ ] Unit tests passing with >90% coverage on service layer
- [ ] Code reviewed and following Kotlin best practices
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities in dependency scan

## Sprint Tasks

### T01 - Database Schema and Migrations (Medium Complexity)
Setup PostgreSQL database schema with matter and audit tables, including Flyway migrations and performance indexes.

### T02 - Matter Entity and JPA Configuration (Medium Complexity)  
Implement Kotlin-based Matter entity with comprehensive JPA mappings, validation, and repository layer.

### T03 - REST API Controller Layer (Medium Complexity)
Build RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations with proper HTTP status codes, pagination, and OpenAPI documentation.

### T04 - Service Layer Business Logic (High Complexity)
Develop service layer orchestrating business workflows, transaction management, and data transformation between entities/DTOs.

### T05 - Status Transition Validation (Medium Complexity)
Implement state machine for matter status transitions with role-based validation and business rules enforcement.

### T06 - Authentication Authorization Integration (High Complexity)
Integrate Spring Security with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and method-level security annotations.

### T07 - Audit Logging System (High Complexity)
Build comprehensive audit trail system capturing all matter changes with event-driven architecture and legal compliance.

### T08 - Unit Tests and Documentation (High Complexity)
Achieve >90% test coverage with JUnit 5/MockK and generate complete OpenAPI documentation with examples.

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Focus on solid foundation - this sprint sets up the core data model
- Ensure proper error handling and validation from the start
- Consider performance implications early (indexes, query optimization)
- Authentication system is assumed to already exist - integrate with it
