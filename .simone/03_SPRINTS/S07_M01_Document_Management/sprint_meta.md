# Sprint: Document Management - Upload, Storage & Viewing (S07)

## Sprint Goal
Implement comprehensive document management system with PDF upload, secure storage, version control, and integrated viewing capabilities

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- File upload API with multipart form handling
- MinIO/GCS object storage integration
- Document metadata storage in PostgreSQL
- Version control system for documents
- PDF viewer component integration in frontend
- Document security with access control
- File type validation and virus scanning
- Thumbnail generation for previews
- Document categorization and tagging
- Batch upload capabilities

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Users can upload PDF documents via drag-and-drop interface
- Documents are securely stored in object storage
- Document versions are tracked with change history
- PDF viewer displays documents without downloading
- Access control prevents unauthorized document viewing
- Upload progress and error handling work smoothly
- Document search by metadata is functional

## Dependencies
- S05_M01_Backend_Foundation (for storage infrastructure)
- S06_M01_Authentication_RBAC (for access control)
- S03_M01_Kanban_Frontend (for UI integration)
