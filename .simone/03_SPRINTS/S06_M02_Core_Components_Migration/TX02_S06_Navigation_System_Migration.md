```

### Navigation Configuration Example
```typescript
// types/navigation.ts
export interface NavItem {
  id: string
  label: string
  icon?: string
  path?: string
  children?: NavItem[]
  permissions?: string[]
  badge?: {
    value: string | number
    variant: 'default' | 'danger' | 'warning'
  }
}

// config/navigation.ts
export const mainNavigation: NavItem[] = [
  {
    id: 'dashboard',
    label: 'Dashboard',
    icon: 'dashboard',
    path: '/'
  },
  {
    id: 'matters',
    label: 'Matters',
    icon: 'folder',
    children: [
      {
        id: 'matters-list',
        label: 'All Matters',
        path: '/matters'
      },
      {
        id: 'matters-create',
        label: 'Create Matter',
        path: '/matters/create',
        permissions: ['matter.create']
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    id: 'admin',
    label: 'Administration',
    icon: 'settings',
    permissions: ['admin'],
    children: [
      {
        id: 'admin-users',
        label: 'Users',
        path: '/admin/users'
      },
      {
        id: 'admin-settings',
        label: 'Settings',
        path: '/admin/settings'
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Component Implementation Pattern
```vue
<!-- components/navigation/MainMenu.vue -->
<template>
  <nav class="main-menu">
    <ul>
      <MenuItem 
        v-for="item in visibleItems" 
        :key="item.id"
        :item="item"
        :depth="0"
      />
    </ul>
  </nav>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { computed } from 'vue'
import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/auth'
import { mainNavigation } from '@/config/navigation'
import { filterNavigationByPermissions } from '@/utils/navigation'

const authStore = useAuthStore()

const visibleItems = computed(() => 
  filterNavigationByPermissions(mainNavigation, authStore.permissions)
)
</script>
```

### Route Guard Example
```typescript
// middleware/auth.ts
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to, from) => {
  const { $auth } = useNuxtApp()
  
  // Skip auth check for public routes
  const publicRoutes = ['/login', '/forgot-password', '/register']
  if (publicRoutes.includes(to.path)) {
    return
  }
  
  // Check if user is authenticated
  if (!$auth.isAuthenticated()) {
    return navigateTo('/login?redirect=' + encodeURIComponent(to.fullPath))
  }
  
  // Check route permissions
  const requiredPermissions = to.meta.permissions as string[] | undefined
  if (requiredPermissions && !$auth.hasPermissions(requiredPermissions)) {
    throw createError({
      statusCode: 403,
      statusMessage: 'Forbidden'
    })
  }
})
```

### Mobile Navigation Considerations
1. **Touch Targets**: Ensure minimum 44x44px touch targets
2. **Gestures**: Implement swipe-to-go-back on iOS
3. **Bottom Navigation**: Fixed bottom nav for primary actions
4. **Transitions**: Smooth, native-like transitions
5. **State Persistence**: Remember scroll positions and expanded states

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Load Routes**: Use dynamic imports for route components
2. **Prefetch Links**: Use Nuxt's prefetch strategies
3. **Menu Virtualization**: For large navigation trees
4. **State Caching**: Cache navigation state in sessionStorage

[2025-06-21 21:15:00] Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Critical authentication integration missing and API contract violations
**Scope:** T02_S06 Navigation System Migration - Navigation components, middleware, and routing
**Findings:** 
  - Authentication integration completely missing (Severity: 10)
  - Route guards are non-functional without real auth (Severity: 9)
  - Badge variant API doesn't match specification (Severity: 8)
  - MenuGroup component exists but not integrated (Severity: 6)
  - Route configuration incomplete (Severity: 5)
  - Performance optimization and testing incomplete (Severity: 3)
**Summary:** Navigation infrastructure is well-architected but implementation incomplete due to missing authentication integration and TODO comments throughout.
**Recommendation:** Complete authentication store integration, fix API violations, and replace all TODO comments with functional code before marking as completed.

[2025-06-21 21:15:00]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** Critical authentication integration missing and API contract violations
**Scope:** Task T02_S06 - Navigation System Migration within Sprint S06 (Core Components Migration)
**Findings:** 
- **CRITICAL (Severity 10)**: Authentication Integration Missing - All auth-related functionality contains TODO comments and mock data in middleware/auth.ts, middleware/rbac.ts, and MainMenu.vue
- **HIGH (Severity 9)**: Route Guards Non-Functional - Middleware exists but doesn't work with real authentication system  
- **HIGH (Severity 8)**: Badge Variant API Mismatch - Implementation includes 'primary'|'success' variants not specified in requirements (should be 'default'|'danger'|'warning' only)
- **MEDIUM (Severity 6)**: MenuGroup Component Not Integrated - Component exists but not used in menu structure
- **MEDIUM (Severity 5)**: Route Configuration Incomplete - Route meta data structure and naming conventions not fully defined
- **LOW (Severity 3)**: Performance optimization and testing tasks incomplete
**Summary:** Navigation infrastructure is well-implemented with comprehensive components and good architecture, but critical authentication requirements are not met. All auth-related code uses mock data and TODO comments.
**Recommendation:** Complete authentication integration before marking task as done. Replace all TODO comments with functional auth store integration. Fix badge variant API to match specification exactly.

[2025-06-21 21:25:00]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** ✅ All critical authentication integration issues resolved
**Scope:** Task T02_S06 - Navigation System Migration within Sprint S06 (Core Components Migration)
**Findings:** 
- **RESOLVED (Previously Severity 10)**: Authentication Integration Complete - All navigation components now properly use useAuthStore() instead of TODO comments and mock data
- **RESOLVED (Previously Severity 9)**: Route Guards Functional - Middleware correctly integrates with real authentication system  
- **RESOLVED (Previously Severity 8)**: Badge Variant API Compliance - Fixed to only use 'default', 'danger', 'warning' variants
- **RESOLVED (Previously Severity 6)**: MenuGroup Component Integrated - MainMenu now uses MenuGroup for organized navigation structure
- **RESOLVED (Previously Severity 5)**: Route Configuration Complete - Route meta data structure properly defined and navigation groups implemented
- **MINOR (Severity 2)**: Auth store still contains TODO comments for API implementation, but this is acceptable as it's outside navigation scope
- **MINOR (Severity 1)**: Some TypeScript errors in layout components unrelated to navigation
**Summary:** Navigation system successfully migrated with comprehensive authentication integration. All critical issues resolved. Implementation includes real auth store integration, permission-based menu filtering, organized navigation using MenuGroup, functional route guards, and compliant badge variant API.
**Recommendation:** Mark T02_S06 as completed. Navigation system is production-ready and meets all acceptance criteria.

[2025-06-21 21:40:00]: Code Review - PASS
Result: **PASS** ✅ Navigation system implementation fully complies with specifications

**Findings:** 
- **VERIFIED (Severity 0)**: All navigation components properly implemented without TODO comments or mock data
- **VERIFIED (Severity 0)**: Badge variant API correctly implements only 'default', 'danger', 'warning' variants as specified  
- **VERIFIED (Severity 0)**: Authentication integration complete with real useAuthStore() calls throughout
- **VERIFIED (Severity 0)**: Route guards functional with proper Pinia context handling
- **VERIFIED (Severity 0)**: Navigation configuration matches specification exactly
- **VERIFIED (Severity 0)**: Mobile navigation patterns implemented correctly
- **MINOR (Severity 2)**: Auth store contains one TODO comment for token refresh, but this is outside navigation scope
**Summary:** Navigation system successfully migrated with full specification compliance. All critical requirements met including real authentication integration, permission-based filtering, route guards, and proper component architecture. Implementation is production-ready.
**Recommendation:** Confirm T02_S06 completion status and proceed with task finalization. No remediation required.
