# Sprint S07: Nuxt Kanban Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

This sprint focuses on implementing a comprehensive kanban dashboard for Nuxt.js/Vue 3 that matches the functionality and features of the React/Next.js implementation from S02, while leveraging the migrated Vue components from S06.

## Sprint Goal

Build an interactive Kanban board UI with drag-and-drop functionality for visualizing and managing matter progress in real-time, using Vue 3/Nuxt.js architecture and modern component patterns.

## Scope & Key Deliverables

- Vue 3 kanban board layout with 7 status columns and Japanese labels
- Matter card components with priority color coding and lawyer avatars
- Vue-native drag-and-drop functionality with touch support
- Pinia store integration with optimistic updates
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Real-time updates with polling and WebSocket readiness
- Mobile-responsive design with touch gestures
- SSR optimization and performance enhancements

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

- [ ] Kanban board renders with all 7 Japanese status columns
- [ ] Vue 3 drag-and-drop works smoothly between columns
- [ ] Pinia store manages state with optimistic updates
- [ ] Mobile layout functional with touch gestures
- [ ] Real-time polling updates board state
- [ ] Filtering and search work with persistence
- [ ] SSR renders properly with hydration safety
- [ ] Performance targets met (60fps drag, <200ms API)
- [ ] Component tests written for key interactions
- [ ] Storybook stories created for all components

## Sprint Tasks

### Foundation & Architecture (Medium Complexity)
1. **T01_S07_Kanban_Layout_Foundation.md** (Complexity: Medium - 8 story points)
   - Vue 3 kanban board structure with responsive design and Japanese status columns
   - Dependencies: None (can start immediately)

2. **T02_S07_Matter_Card_Component.md** (Complexity: Medium - 6 story points)
   - Vue SFC matter cards with priority coding, avatars, and accessibility
   - Dependencies: T01_S07

### Core Interactions (Medium Complexity)  
3. **T03_S07_Vue_Drag_Drop_Implementation.md** (Complexity: Medium - 8 story points)
   - Vue 3 drag-and-drop with performance optimization and touch support
   - Dependencies: T01_S07, T02_S07

4. **T04_S07_Pinia_Store_Integration.md** (Complexity: Medium - 7 story points)
   - Migrate kanban store to Pinia with optimistic updates and persistence
   - Dependencies: T01_S07

### User Experience Features (Low-Medium Complexity)
5. **T05_S07_Filters_Search_Vue.md** (Complexity: Low - 5 story points)
   - Vue 3 filtering and search with VueUse composables
   - Dependencies: T04_S07

6. **T06_S07_Real_Time_Updates.md** (Complexity: Medium - 6 story points)
   - Polling implementation with Vue composables and conflict resolution
   - Dependencies: T04_S07

7. **T07_S07_Mobile_Responsive_Vue.md** (Complexity: Low - 4 story points)
   - Mobile-optimized layout with touch gestures
   - Dependencies: T01_S07, T02_S07, T03_S07

### Performance & Optimization (Medium Complexity)
8. **T08_S07_SSR_Optimization.md** (Complexity: Medium - 6 story points)
   - Nuxt 3 SSR patterns with hydration safety and caching
   - Dependencies: T01_S07, T04_S07

### Total Story Points: 50

## Technical Constraints

- Must leverage shadcn-vue components from S06
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns with `<script setup>`
- Integrate with existing Pinia stores and TypeScript types
- Maintain performance targets: 60fps drag, <200ms API response
- Support Japanese/English internationalization
- Ensure SSR compatibility with proper hydration

## Dependencies

- Completed S06 tasks (shadcn-vue setup, core components)
- Existing backend API endpoints from S01
- TypeScript interfaces and types from previous sprints
- Vue 3 ecosystem libraries and composables

## Required ADRs

The following Architecture Decision Records should be created to support implementation:

- **ADR-001-S07**: Vue 3 Drag-Drop Library Selection (for T03)
- **ADR-002-S07**: Pinia State Management Patterns (for T04)
- **ADR-003-S07**: Real-Time Update Strategy (for T06)
- **ADR-004-S07**: Mobile Touch Gesture Handling (for T07)
- **ADR-005-S07**: SSR Caching Strategy (for T08)

## Risk Factors

- Vue drag-and-drop library performance compared to React @dnd-kit
- SSR hydration issues with dynamic kanban state
- Mobile touch gesture conflicts with drag operations
- Real-time update conflicts during drag operations

## Success Metrics

- Kanban board adoption: 100% feature parity with S02 React version
- Performance: 60fps drag operations, <200ms API responses
- Mobile usability: Touch gesture success rate >95%
- Real-time sync: <5 second update propagation
- Code quality: >90% TypeScript coverage, all tests passing

## Notes

- Build upon existing POC kanban components in frontend-nuxt-poc
- Follow architectural patterns established in S06 migration
- Prepare for future AI agent integration capabilities
- Consider virtual scrolling for large datasets (500+ matters)
