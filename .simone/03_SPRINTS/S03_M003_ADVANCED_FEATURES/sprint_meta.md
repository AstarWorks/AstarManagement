# S03_M003: Advanced Expense Features

## Sprint Goal
Implement advanced expense management features including CSV import for bulk operations, comprehensive reporting dashboards, and file attachment handling for receipt management.

## Key Deliverables
- CSV import interface with preview and validation
- CSV template download and format documentation
- Reporting dashboard with key metrics and charts
- Expense analytics by category, date, and case
- File attachment upload with drag-and-drop
- Attachment preview (images and PDFs)
- Tag management interface for categorization
- Bulk operations for expense management
- Export functionality (CSV, Excel, PDF)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] CSV import handles files up to 1000 rows
- [ ] Import preview shows validation errors clearly
- [ ] Import process includes progress indication
- [ ] Reporting dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Charts are interactive and responsive
- [ ] File upload supports drag-and-drop
- [ ] Image attachments show thumbnails
- [ ] PDF attachments display preview
- [ ] Tag creation and assignment works smoothly
- [ ] Bulk delete/update operations confirmed
- [ ] Export generates valid files
- [ ] All features mobile accessible
- [ ] Performance targets met for large datasets
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified

## Dependencies
- Completed S02_M003 core CRUD operations
- Chart library integration (Chart.js or similar)
- File upload service configuration
- CSV parsing library selection
- Export library implementation

## Tasks
- T01_S03_M003: CSV Import Foundation - Parser setup, template generation, format documentation (6 hours)
- T02_S03_M003: CSV Import UI - Upload interface, preview, validation display (8 hours)
- T03_S03_M003: Reporting Dashboard Layout - Dashboard structure, metric cards, filters (7 hours)
- T04_S03_M003: Analytics Charts - Chart implementations for expense analytics (8 hours)
- T05_S03_M003: File Upload Component - Drag-and-drop, progress, chunked uploads (6 hours)
- T06_S03_M003: Attachment Management - Preview components, viewers, thumbnails (7 hours)
- T07_S03_M003: Tag Management UI - CRUD interface, assignment, usage stats (8 hours)
- T08_S03_M003: Bulk Operations - Multi-select, batch actions, confirmations (6 hours)
- T09_S03_M003: Export Functionality - Multi-format export implementation (7 hours)

**Total Estimated Hours**: 63 hours (7-8 days)

## Technical Considerations
- Use Web Workers for CSV parsing
- Implement chunked file uploads
- Client-side image optimization
- Chart performance with large datasets
- Virtual scrolling for long lists
- Lazy loading for attachments
- Proper memory management
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Notes
Advanced features significantly enhance productivity for power users. CSV import is critical for migrating existing data and bulk operations. Reporting provides insights for financial planning. File attachments ensure proper documentation. Focus on performance and user feedback during long operations.
