# T09_S02_M002_Tag_Repository_Integration_Tests.md

## Task Meta Information
- **Task ID**: T09_S02_M002
- **Task Name**: Tag Repository Integration Tests
- **Sprint**: S02_M002_EXPENSE_DATABASE
- **Estimated Hours**: 3
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Updated**: 2025-08-13 13:37
- **Assigned**: Backend Developer
- **Dependencies**: 
  - T07_S02_M002: Repository Implementation must be completed
  - Tag domain model and JPA entities must exist
  - Test database configuration must be ready

## Purpose
Implement comprehensive integration tests for the TagRepository to ensure proper data persistence, tenant isolation, and all repository operations work correctly with the actual database.

## Research Findings
Based on analysis of existing implementations:

### Existing TagRepository Interface
Located in `backend/src/main/kotlin/com/astarworks/astarmanagement/expense/domain/repository/TagRepository.kt`:
- Supports tenant-based isolation
- Provides scope-based filtering (personal vs shared tags)
- Includes usage analytics capabilities
- Soft delete functionality

### Existing TagRepositoryImpl
Located in `backend/src/main/kotlin/com/astarworks/astarmanagement/expense/infrastructure/persistence/TagRepositoryImpl.kt`:
- Implements all interface methods
- Uses JpaTagRepository for database operations
- Handles tenant security context

### Current Test Coverage
- `TagRepositoryIntegrationTest.kt` exists but needs expansion
- Missing test cases for:
  - Scope-based filtering
  - Usage count updates
  - Concurrent access scenarios
  - Performance with large datasets

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All TagRepository methods have integration tests
- [ ] Tenant isolation is verified for all operations
- [ ] Scope filtering (personal/shared) works correctly
- [ ] Usage statistics are accurately tracked
- [ ] Soft delete functionality is tested
- [ ] Tests run successfully in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test coverage reaches >90% for TagRepositoryImpl
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are documented

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Structure
```kotlin
@ActiveProfiles("test")
class TagRepositoryIntegrationTest : RepositoryTest() {
    // Test categories:
    // 1. CRUD Operations
    // 2. Tenant Isolation
    // 3. Scope Filtering
    // 4. Usage Analytics
    // 5. Soft Delete
    // 6. Performance Tests
}
```

### Key Test Cases
1. **CRUD Operations**
   - Create tag with valid data
   - Update tag properties
   - Find tag by ID
   - Delete tag (soft delete)

2. **Tenant Isolation**
   - Tags from different tenants are isolated
   - No cross-tenant data leakage
   - Tenant context is properly enforced

3. **Scope Filtering**
   - Personal tags visible only to owner
   - Shared tags visible to all in tenant
   - Proper filtering in findByScope methods

4. **Usage Analytics**
   - Usage count increments correctly
   - Last used timestamp updates
   - Bulk usage updates work properly

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Duplicate tag names within scope
   - Unicode and special characters in tag names
   - Maximum tag limits per tenant/user

### Test Data Requirements
- Multiple tenants for isolation testing
- Multiple users per tenant for scope testing
- Large dataset for performance testing (1000+ tags)

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot Test framework
- Testcontainers for PostgreSQL
- Test fixtures for tag creation
- Security context mocking utilities

## Output Log
[2025-08-13 13:37]: Task started - analyzing existing TagRepositoryIntegrationTest implementation
[2025-08-13 13:37]: Found comprehensive existing test file with 661 lines covering all major areas:
  - ✅ CRUD Operations (lines 37-125)
  - ✅ Tenant Isolation & RLS (lines 298-372) 
  - ✅ Scope Filtering (lines 126-216)
  - ✅ Usage Analytics (lines 217-297)
  - ✅ Soft Delete (lines 107-124)
  - ✅ Performance Tests (lines 481-565)
  - ✅ Data Integrity (lines 374-463)
  - ✅ Edge Cases & Concurrency (lines 567-634)
[2025-08-13 13:37]: Discovered test execution issues - ApplicationContext loading failure
[2025-08-13 13:37]: All 23 tests failing due to context configuration, not test implementation
[2025-08-13 13:37]: Infrastructure analysis: 
  - ✅ DatabaseIntegrationTestBase exists with proper TestContainers setup
  - ✅ Tag domain model exists
  - ✅ TagRepository interface and implementation exist
  - ✅ JpaTagRepository exists
  - ✅ Database migrations exist (V023, V026, V028)
[2025-08-13 13:37]: Current status: Investigation required - comprehensive tests exist but infrastructure setup has issues
[2025-08-13 13:47]: Infrastructure fixes applied:
  - ✅ application-test.properties package name corrected
  - ✅ User entity updated with tenantId field 
  - ✅ DatabaseIntegrationTestBase User creation updated
  - ✅ AuthenticationService User creation updated
[2025-08-13 13:48]: Tests still failing - ApplicationContext loading failure persists despite infrastructure fixes
[2025-08-13 13:48]: Status: Infrastructure issues are deeper than initially assessed - may require expert guidance

[2025-08-13 13:51]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** The implementation is comprehensive and meets all requirements but fails due to critical infrastructure issues preventing test execution.
**Scope:** T09_S02_M002_Tag_Repository_Integration_Tests - comprehensive code review of TagRepositoryIntegrationTest implementation and infrastructure.
**Findings:** 
  1. ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (Severity 0): All 23 test methods cover every requirement from T09 specifications
     - CRUD operations with tenant isolation
     - Tag scope management (TENANT vs PERSONAL) 
     - Usage analytics and tracking
     - Multi-tenant security and RLS enforcement
     - Data integrity and uniqueness constraints
     - Performance benchmarks (<100ms requirement)
     - Edge cases and error scenarios
  2. 🔴 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE (Severity 10): All tests failing with Hibernate InstantiationException
     - Unable to instantiate User entity during test execution
     - ApplicationContext loading failure persists despite previous fixes
     - Tests cannot execute due to entity configuration issues
  3. 🟡 TASK SCOPE DISCREPANCY (Severity 3): Implementation was delivered as part of T08_S02_M002 instead of T09
     - TagRepositoryIntegrationTest was created in T08 commit (849e8b0) 
     - However, content fully satisfies T09 requirements (661 lines, 23 tests)
  4. 🟡 STATUS INCONSISTENCY (Severity 2): Task marked "In Progress" but implementation is complete
**Summary:** While the TagRepositoryIntegrationTest implementation is exemplary and covers all T09 requirements comprehensively, it fails the code review due to critical infrastructure issues preventing any test execution. The test code itself is production-ready but the underlying Spring Boot test configuration has fundamental problems.
**Recommendation:** FAIL - Infrastructure issues must be resolved before this task can be considered complete. Recommend expert review of test configuration, entity mappings, and Testcontainers setup to resolve the Hibernate InstantiationException.
