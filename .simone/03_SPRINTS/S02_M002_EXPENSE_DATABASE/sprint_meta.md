# S02_M002: Expense Database Implementation

## Sprint Goal
Implement the complete database schema for expense management, including all tables, indexes, constraints, and initial test data.

## Key Deliverables
- Expense table with full schema (expenses)
- Tag management tables (tags, expense_tags)
- Attachment tables (attachments, expense_attachment_relations)
- Flyway migrations V018-V025
- Database indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenancy
- Test data seeders
- Repository implementations with Spring Data JPA
- Integration tests for database operations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All expense-related tables created via migrations
- [ ] Indexes implemented for common queries
- [ ] Foreign key constraints properly defined
- [ ] RLS policies enforce tenant isolation
- [ ] Test data seeder creates realistic sample data
- [ ] Repository implementations pass all tests
- [ ] Database schema documented
- [ ] Migration rollback tested
- [ ] Performance baseline established

## Dependencies
- S01_M002 completion (repository interfaces)
- Existing tenant and user tables from V017

## Tasks
- T01_S02_M002: Expense Table Tenant Migration (3 hours) - COMPLETED in V017
- T02_S02_M002: Tag Management Tables Implementation (4 hours)
- T03_S02_M002: Attachment Tables Implementation (4 hours)
- T04_S02_M002: Performance Indexes Implementation (3 hours)
- T05_S02_M002: Row Level Security Policies (4 hours)
- T06_S02_M002: Test Data Seeder Implementation (3 hours)
- T07_S02_M002: Repository Implementation (5 hours)
- T08_S02_M002: Database Integration Tests (4 hours)

**Total Estimated Hours**: 30 hours (5 days)

## Notes
This sprint transforms the schema design into actual database implementation. Special attention to multi-tenant isolation and performance optimization through proper indexing. The implementation follows an incremental approach to ensure the build remains stable throughout development.
