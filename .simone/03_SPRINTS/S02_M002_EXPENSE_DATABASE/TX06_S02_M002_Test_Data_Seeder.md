# T06_S02_M002: Test Data Seeder Implementation

## Purpose
Create a comprehensive test data seeder to populate the database with realistic legal firm expense scenarios for development and testing purposes. This seeder will provide representative data across all expense-related entities to support feature development and testing.

## Background Research
The codebase currently has:
- Domain models: `Expense`, `Tag`, `Attachment`, `ExpenseAttachment` in `backend/src/main/kotlin/com/astarworks/astarmanagement/expense/domain/model/`
- Repository interfaces: `ExpenseRepository`, `TagRepository`, `AttachmentRepository` in `backend/src/main/kotlin/com/astarworks/astarmanagement/expense/domain/repository/`
- Repository implementations using Spring Data JPA in `backend/src/main/kotlin/com/astarworks/astarmanagement/expense/infrastructure/persistence/`
- Test fixtures: `ExpenseFixtures`, `TagFixtures` in `backend/src/test/kotlin/com/astarworks/astarmanagement/expense/fixtures/`
- Multi-tenant database schema with RLS policies
- Existing tenant infrastructure with demo tenant: `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-000000000001`

## Description
Implement a Spring Boot data seeder that creates realistic test data representing typical legal firm expense scenarios. The seeder should populate expenses with various categories, date ranges, amounts, and relationships to demonstrate the full functionality of the expense management system.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Create a `TestDataSeeder` class implementing `CommandLineRunner` or using `@PostConstruct`
- [ ] Seed data only in development/test profiles (`dev`, `test`)
- [ ] Properly handle multi-tenant data isolation using existing tenant structure
- [ ] Use repository implementations to save data (not direct JPA/SQL)
- [ ] Implement idempotent seeding (check if data exists before creating)

### Test Data Scenarios

#### Expense Categories
- [ ] **Transportation expenses**: 電車代, タクシー代, 駐車場代, 高速道路代
- [ ] **Accommodation expenses**: ホテル代, 出張宿泊費  
- [ ] **Meeting expenses**: 会議室代, 懇親会費, 接待費
- [ ] **Communication expenses**: 電話代, 郵送料, 宅配便代
- [ ] **Office supplies**: 文房具, 印刷用紙, トナー代
- [ ] **Professional materials**: 法律書籍, 判例資料, 研修費
- [ ] **Legal fees**: 印紙代, 登記手数料, 裁判手数料
- [ ] **Other expenses**: その他実費

#### Expense Patterns
- [ ] **Date range**: Create expenses across last 6 months with realistic distribution
- [ ] **Amount variety**: Small daily expenses (¥100-¥5,000) to large professional fees (¥10,000-¥100,000)
- [ ] **Income entries**: 着手金, 報酬金, 相談料 for balance demonstration
- [ ] **Case associations**: Link expenses to different case scenarios (if case data exists)
- [ ] **Mixed patterns**: Both billable and non-billable expenses

#### Tag Management
- [ ] Create tenant-wide tags for common categories
- [ ] Create personal tags for individual lawyer preferences  
- [ ] Assign multiple tags to expenses realistically
- [ ] Ensure proper usage count tracking

#### Attachment Scenarios
- [ ] Create sample attachment metadata (without actual files)
- [ ] Various file types: PDF receipts, image receipts, Excel reports
- [ ] Different attachment statuses: linked, temporary (for testing cleanup)
- [ ] Multiple attachments per expense for complex scenarios

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Proper tenant isolation using existing `tenantId` from demo tenant
- [ ] Use existing user IDs for audit fields (`created_by`, `updated_by`)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Follow existing patterns from test fixtures
- [ ] Respect domain model constraints and business rules

## Technical Guidance

### Implementation Approach
1. **Create seeder class**: `TestDataSeeder` in `backend/src/main/kotlin/com/astarworks/astarmanagement/expense/infrastructure/seed/`
2. **Use Spring profiles**: Activate only for `dev` and `test` profiles using `@Profile("dev", "test")`
3. **Dependency injection**: Inject repository implementations (not JPA repositories directly)
4. **Idempotent seeding**: Check if demo tenant already has expense data before seeding

### Spring Boot DataSeeder Pattern
```kotlin
@Component
@Profile("dev", "test")
class TestDataSeeder(
    private val expenseRepository: ExpenseRepository,
    private val tagRepository: TagRepository,
    private val attachmentRepository: AttachmentRepository,
    private val userRepository: UserRepository
) : CommandLineRunner {
    
    override fun run(vararg args: String?) {
        if (!shouldSeedData()) return
        seedExpenseData()
    }
    
    private fun shouldSeedData(): Boolean {
        // Check if demo tenant already has expenses
    }
}
```

### Data Creation Strategy
1. **Realistic scenarios**: Base expenses on actual legal practice patterns
2. **Temporal distribution**: Spread expenses across realistic time periods
3. **Relational consistency**: Ensure proper FK relationships and tenant isolation
4. **Business logic compliance**: Follow domain model constraints
5. **Performance consideration**: Batch operations where possible

### 3. Expense Data Creation (90 minutes)
- [ ] Create transportation expenses with realistic amounts and descriptions
- [ ] Create accommodation and travel-related expenses
- [ ] Create office supplies and professional material expenses
- [ ] Create legal fees and court-related expenses
- [ ] Create income entries (着手金, 報酬金) for balance calculation
- [ ] Assign tags to expenses realistically
- [ ] Set proper date distribution across recent months

### 4. Attachment Data Creation (30 minutes)
- [ ] Create sample attachment metadata for different file types
- [ ] Link attachments to expenses appropriately

- [ ] All repository methods used correctly (no direct JPA access)
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging implemented
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and conventions

## Implementation Notes

### Legal Expense Categories (Japanese Context)
Focus on expenses common in Japanese legal practices:
- **実費 (Jippi)**: Actual expenses that can be billed to clients
- **事務所経費**: Office operational expenses  
- **専門書籍費**: Professional legal materials
- **研修費**: Continuing legal education
- **交通費**: Transportation for court appearances and client meetings
- **通信費**: Communication costs for case management

### Multi-Tenant Considerations
- All seeded data must use the demo tenant ID: `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-000000000001`
- Ensure proper audit fields are populated with existing user IDs
- Respect RLS policies by using repository methods rather than direct database access
- Consider creating data for multiple user roles (lawyer, staff, admin)

### Performance Notes
- Use batch operations where repositories support them
- Consider using Spring's `@Transactional` for data consistency
- Log progress for long-running seed operations
- Implement graceful failure handling for constraint violations

This task creates a foundation of realistic test data that will support all subsequent expense management feature development and testing.
