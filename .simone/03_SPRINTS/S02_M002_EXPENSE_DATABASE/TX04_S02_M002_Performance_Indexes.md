## Description
Implement comprehensive database indexes for optimal query performance on expense-related tables. This task focuses on analyzing existing query patterns from repository implementations and creating strategic indexes to improve performance for the most common expense management operations.

The implementation will optimize performance for tenant-isolated queries, expense filtering operations, tag-based searches, and attachment retrieval patterns while maintaining the existing index structure from domain models.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyzed all expense-related query patterns from repository implementations
- [ ] Created comprehensive indexes for expenses table beyond existing ones
- [ ] Optimized tag-based query performance with additional indexes
- [ ] Added attachment-related performance indexes
- [ ] Implemented composite indexes for complex filtering operations
- [ ] Added partial indexes for frequently accessed subsets
- [ ] Followed established index naming conventions
- [ ] Verified all indexes improve query performance without degrading insert/update performance
- [ ] Applied database statistics analysis before and after index creation
- [ ] All existing application queries continue to work efficiently

## Technical Guidance

### Migration Details
- **Migration File**: V029__Add_expense_performance_indexes.sql
- **Target Tables**: expenses, tags, expense_tags, expense_attachments, attachments
- **Reference Files**: 
  - JpaExpenseRepository.kt (query patterns)
  - JpaTagRepository.kt (tag query patterns)
  - V008__Add_performance_indexes.sql (naming conventions)
  - V023__Create_tag_management_tables.sql (existing tag indexes)

### Query Pattern Analysis
Based on repository analysis, the following query patterns need optimization:

#### Expense Repository Queries
1. **findByIdAndTenantId**: tenant_id + id lookup (already optimized by PK)
2. **findByTenantId**: tenant_id + ordering by date DESC, created_at DESC
3. **findByFilters**: Complex filtering on tenant_id, date range, case_id, category
4. **findByTagIds**: JOIN with expense_tags and tags tables
5. **calculatePreviousBalance**: tenant_id + date range with exclusions

#### Tag Repository Queries  
1. **findByTenantIdAndScope**: tenant_id + scope filtering
2. **findByNamePattern**: LIKE queries on tag names (case-insensitive)
3. **findMostUsedTags**: Complex subqueries counting tag usage in expenses
4. **existsByTenantIdAndNameIgnoreCase**: Case-insensitive name lookups

### Index Implementation Strategy

#### 1. Expense Table Indexes
```sql
-- Composite index for filtered queries (date range, case, category)
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_tenant_filters ON expenses(tenant_id, date, case_id, category)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Composite index for date range queries with ordering
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_tenant_date_created ON expenses(tenant_id, date DESC, created_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Partial index for case-related expenses (commonly filtered)
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_case_active ON expenses(case_id, date DESC)
WHERE case_id IS NOT NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Index for category-based filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_tenant_category ON expenses(tenant_id, category, date DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Index for balance calculation queries
CREATE INDEX idx_expenses_balance_calc ON expenses(tenant_id, date, id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

#### 2. Tag Performance Indexes
```sql
-- Case-insensitive name search optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_tags_name_lower ON tags(tenant_id, LOWER(name))
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Scope-based access patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_tags_tenant_scope_name ON tags(tenant_id, scope, name)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Personal tag owner lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_tags_owner_scope ON tags(owner_id, scope)
WHERE scope = 'PERSONAL' AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```

#### 3. Expense-Tags Junction Optimization
```sql
-- Optimize tag-based expense queries
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_tags_tag_expense ON expense_tags(tag_id, expense_id);

-- Tenant-based junction queries
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_tags_tenant_tag ON expense_tags(tenant_id, tag_id);

-- Optimize expense deletion cleanup
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_tags_expense_cleanup ON expense_tags(expense_id, tenant_id);
```

#### 4. Attachment Performance Indexes
```sql
-- Expense attachment lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_expense_attachments_expense ON expense_attachments(expense_id, attachment_id);

-- Tenant-based attachment queries
CREATE INDEX idx_attachments_tenant_created ON attachments(tenant_id, created_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- File type based filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_attachments_type_size ON attachments(file_type, file_size)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

## Implementation Notes

### Step 1: Analyze Current Query Performance
- Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on key repository queries
- Capture baseline performance metrics
- Identify slow queries and missing index opportunities

### Step 2: Create Core Expense Indexes
- Focus on tenant_id + date combinations (most common pattern)
- Add composite indexes for multi-field filtering
- Create partial indexes for soft-deleted records

### Step 3: Optimize Tag Query Performance
- Address case-insensitive search patterns
- Optimize tag usage counting queries
- Improve personal vs tenant tag filtering

### Step 4: Junction Table Optimization
- Optimize many-to-many relationship queries
- Add indexes for cleanup operations
- Improve tag-based expense filtering

### Step 5: Attachment Query Optimization
- Add indexes for file-based operations
- Optimize tenant-based attachment queries
- Index file metadata for filtering

### Step 6: Verify Performance Improvements
- Re-run query analysis to measure improvements
- Ensure insert/update performance is not degraded
- Update table statistics after index creation

### Index Naming Convention
Following V008__Add_performance_indexes.sql pattern:
- `idx_[table]_[columns]` for regular indexes
- `idx_[table]_[purpose]` for functional indexes
- Add `_partial` suffix for partial indexes
- Use descriptive names for composite indexes

### Partial Index Strategy
Use WHERE clauses to exclude:
- Soft-deleted records (`deleted_at IS NULL`)
- Optional fields (`field IS NOT NULL`)
- Specific scopes (`scope = 'PERSONAL'`)

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check current query performance
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT e.* FROM expenses e 
WHERE e.tenant_id = ? AND e.date BETWEEN ? AND ?
ORDER BY e.date DESC, e.created_at DESC;

# Verify index creation
\di expenses
\di tags
\di expense_tags

# Check index usage statistics
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('expenses', 'tags', 'expense_tags')
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

# Analyze table statistics
ANALYZE expenses;
ANALYZE tags;
ANALYZE expense_tags;
ANALYZE attachments;

# Check index sizes
SELECT tablename, indexname, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('expenses', 'tags', 'expense_tags')
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;
```

## Performance Expectations
- **Expense list queries**: < 50ms for tenant data with 10k+ records
- **Tag filtering**: < 20ms for tag-based expense searches
- **Date range queries**: < 30ms for monthly/yearly reports
- **Case-based filtering**: < 25ms for case-specific expense lists
- **Balance calculations**: < 100ms for running balance updates

## Notes
- Indexes build on existing V023 tag indexes - do not duplicate
- Focus on composite indexes for complex filtering patterns identified in repositories
- Partial indexes preferred for commonly accessed subsets (non-deleted records)
- Monitor index usage statistics after deployment to identify unused indexes
- Consider covering indexes for frequently accessed columns
- Balance query performance with insert/update overhead
