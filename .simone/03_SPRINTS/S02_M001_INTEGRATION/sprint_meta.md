# Sprint S02: Frontend-Backend Integration & Testing

## Sprint Goal
Integrate the existing frontend authentication components with the newly implemented backend API, complete end-to-end testing, and finalize all milestone requirements for a production-ready authentication system.

## Sprint Scope

### High-Level Deliverables
- [ ] Frontend-backend API integration for authentication
- [ ] End-to-end authentication flow testing
- [ ] Storybook stories for all authentication components
- [ ] Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Security review and hardening
- [ ] Documentation and deployment readiness

### Key Features Integrated
1. **Frontend API Integration**
   - Update AuthStore to use real backend endpoints
   - Error handling for API failures and network issues
   - Token refresh mechanism working with backend
   - Loading states and user feedback

2. **Component Enhancement**
   - LoginForm integration with real authentication
   - Layout components (AppHeader, AppSidebar) connected to auth state
   - Navigation and routing based on user permissions
   - Mobile responsiveness verification

3. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Storybook stories for LoginForm and layout components
   - Unit tests for AuthStore and middleware
   - Integration tests for complete auth flow
   - API documentation in Swagger UI

4. **Security & Production Readiness**
   - Security review of authentication flow
   - Performance testing of auth endpoints
   - Error message sanitization
   - Audit logging verification

## Implementation Tasks

### Integration Tasks (High Priority)
- [ ] **[T01_S02_AuthStore_API_Integration](./T01_S02_AuthStore_API_Integration.md)** (4h) - Update Pinia AuthStore to integrate with real backend authentication endpoints
- [ ] **[T02_S02_Error_Handling_Enhancement](./T02_S02_Error_Handling_Enhancement.md)** (3h) - Implement comprehensive error handling for network failures and API errors
- [ ] **[T03_S02_Token_Refresh_Implementation](./T03_S02_Token_Refresh_Implementation.md)** (2h) - Implement automatic JWT token refresh mechanism with concurrency handling
- [ ] **[T04_S02_Route_Protection_Verification](./T04_S02_Route_Protection_Verification.md)** (2h) - Verify and enhance route protection middleware with real authentication

### Testing & Documentation Tasks (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **[T05_S02_LoginForm_Storybook_Stories](./T05_S02_LoginForm_Storybook_Stories.md)** (3h) - Create comprehensive Storybook stories for LoginForm component
- [ ] **[T06_S02_AuthStore_Unit_Tests](./T06_S02_AuthStore_Unit_Tests.md)** (3h) - Create comprehensive unit tests for AuthStore functionality
- [ ] **[T07_S02_E2E_Integration_Tests](./T07_S02_E2E_Integration_Tests.md)** (4h) - Create end-to-end integration tests using Playwright

### Production Readiness (High Priority)
- [ ] **[T08_S02_Security_Production_Readiness](./T08_S02_Security_Production_Readiness.md)** (3h) - Implement security hardening measures and production readiness checks

**Total Estimated Effort: 24 hours (3 days)**

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **S01_M001_BACKEND_AUTH must be completed** - All backend APIs must be functional
- Frontend components already exist and are mostly ready
- Database schema must be deployed and accessible

### External Dependencies
- Development environment properly configured
- Test data available for different user roles
- Storybook and testing frameworks set up

## Risks and Mitigations

### High Risk
- **API Integration Issues**: Thorough testing of network scenarios and error states
- **Performance Problems**: Load testing auth endpoints early in sprint

### Medium Risk
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Test on real devices, not just browser dev tools
- **Security Gaps**: Comprehensive security review with checklist

### Low Risk
- **Documentation Completeness**: Automate documentation generation where possible

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Login time <3 seconds from form submission to dashboard
- [ ] Clear error messages for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Mobile experience functional on devices >320px width

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] API response time <200ms for auth endpoints
- [ ] Test coverage >80% for auth-related code
- [ ] Build time <30 seconds for full frontend build
- [ ] Bundle size <500KB for auth-related frontend code

### Security Metrics
- [ ] Security checklist 100% completed
- [ ] No sensitive data in error messages or logs
- [ ] Audit trail captures all authentication events

## Sprint Validation

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] User can log in with valid credentials
- [ ] Invalid credentials show appropriate error
- [ ] Token refresh works seamlessly
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when needed
- [ ] User can log out and state is cleared properly
- [ ] Different user roles see appropriate UI elements

### Automated Testing
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Storybook builds without errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Linting passes without warnings
