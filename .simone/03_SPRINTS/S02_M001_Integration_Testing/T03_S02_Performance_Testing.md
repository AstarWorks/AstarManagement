# T03_S02: Performance Testing Framework

## Task Overview

Implement a comprehensive performance testing framework for the Auth0 integration, focusing on JWT validation latency, proxy overhead measurement, JWKS caching effectiveness, and concurrent request handling. This task builds on the existing k6 performance testing infrastructure discovered in the codebase.

## Objectives

- Set up performance testing framework for Auth0 JWT validation
- Measure JWT validation latency with <50ms target (p95)
- Test concurrent request handling capabilities
- Validate JWKS caching effectiveness and hit rates
- Establish performance baselines and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] JWT validation latency < 50ms (p95)
- [ ] Proxy overhead < 10ms 
- [ ] JWKS cache hit rate > 95%
- [ ] Support 100+ concurrent requests without degradation
- [ ] Performance reports generated with metrics visualization
- [ ] Automated performance threshold validation
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline for regression detection

## Subtasks

### 1. Performance Test Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Extend existing k6 test suite (found in `.github/workflows/performance-tests.yml`)
- [ ] Create JWT-specific performance test scenarios
- [ ] Set up performance metrics collection and storage
- [ ] Configure test data generation for realistic scenarios

### 2. JWT Validation Performance Tests
- [ ] Create baseline JWT validation tests
- [ ] Implement load testing for JWT endpoint validation
- [ ] Test JWT token parsing and claims extraction performance
- [ ] Measure `JwtAuthenticationConverter` and `JwtClaimsExtractor` latency

### 3. JWKS Caching Performance Tests
- [ ] Test JWKS endpoint response times
- [ ] Validate Caffeine cache effectiveness (configured in `application.yml`)
- [ ] Test cache hit/miss ratios under load
- [ ] Measure impact of Resilience4j circuit breaker on JWKS calls

### 4. Concurrent Request Handling
- [ ] Test authentication under concurrent load (100+ requests)
- [ ] Validate HikariCP connection pool performance under load
- [ ] Test tenant context isolation performance
- [ ] Measure database connection pool utilization

### 5. Performance Monitoring Integration
- [ ] Integrate with Spring Boot Actuator metrics
- [ ] Set up Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Create performance dashboards
- [ ] Implement alerting for performance degradation

## Technical Guidance

### Performance Testing Tools
Based on codebase analysis, the project uses:
- **k6**: Already configured in GitHub Actions for load testing
- **Spring Boot Actuator**: Configured with metrics endpoints (`/actuator/metrics`)
- **Prometheus**: Enabled for metrics export
- **Caffeine Cache**: Configured for JWKS caching with 5-minute TTL

### Key Performance Paths Identified

#### JWT Validation Pipeline
```
HTTP Request → SecurityFilterChain → JwtAuthenticationConverter → JwtClaimsExtractor → TenantContextService
```

#### Database Connection Configuration
Current HikariCP settings (from `application.yml`):
- Maximum pool size: 10
- Minimum idle: 2
- Connection timeout: 30s
- Idle timeout: 10m

#### JWKS Caching Configuration
- **Cache Type**: Caffeine (local)
- **Cache Spec**: `maximumSize=100,expireAfterWrite=5m`
- **Circuit Breaker**: Configured for JWKS endpoint with 50% failure threshold

### Metrics Collection Approach

#### Primary Metrics
- JWT validation duration (p50, p95, p99)
- JWKS cache hit ratio
- Connection pool active/idle connections
- Request throughput (requests/second)
- Error rates by endpoint

#### Performance Thresholds
```yaml
jwt_validation_p95: <50ms
jwks_cache_hit_rate: >95%
concurrent_requests: >100
proxy_overhead: <10ms
database_response: <100ms
```

```

### Test Data Generation
Create test scenarios with:
- Multiple tenant contexts
- Various JWT claim structures
- Different user roles and permissions
- Mixed authenticated/unauthenticated requests

### Monitoring Integration
Leverage existing monitoring setup:
- Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`)
- Prometheus metrics export
- Circuit breaker metrics from Resilience4j

## Dependencies

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- PostgreSQL test database (configured in GitHub Actions)
- Redis instance for session/cache testing
- Mock Auth0 service (existing `MockAuthService`)

### Testing Dependencies
- k6 load testing tool (already configured)
- Test data fixtures
- Performance baseline data

### Monitoring Dependencies
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Performance dashboard setup
- Alert configuration

## Testing Approach

### Load Testing Strategy
1. **Baseline Tests**: Single-user performance benchmarks
2. **Load Tests**: Normal traffic simulation (10-50 concurrent users)
3. **Stress Tests**: Peak load simulation (100+ concurrent users)
4. **Spike Tests**: Sudden load increase scenarios

### Test Scenarios
```javascript
// JWT Validation Performance Test
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 10 },   // Ramp up
    { duration: '5m', target: 50 },   // Stay at load
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },    // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<50'],  // 95% under 50ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.1'],    // Error rate under 10%
  },
};
```

### Cache Effectiveness Testing
Test JWKS cache behavior:
- Cold start performance
- Cache warming strategies  
- Cache invalidation scenarios
- Cache hit ratio measurement

### Database Performance Testing
Monitor connection pool behavior:
- Connection acquisition time
- Active vs idle connections
- Connection timeout scenarios
- Query execution time under load

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Baselines
Establish baseline metrics for:
- JWT validation latency
- JWKS retrieval and caching
- Database query performance
- Overall request processing time

### Performance Reports
Generate comprehensive reports with:
- Performance trend analysis
- Bottleneck identification
- Resource utilization metrics
- Recommendations for optimization

### CI/CD Integration
Automated performance validation in the deployment pipeline with:
- Performance regression detection
- Threshold-based build failures
- Performance trend reporting
- Alert integration

## Success Criteria

The task is complete when:
1. All acceptance criteria are met with documented evidence
2. Performance tests are integrated into CI/CD pipeline
3. Performance baselines are established and documented
4. Monitoring dashboards are created and functional
5. Performance regression detection is automated
