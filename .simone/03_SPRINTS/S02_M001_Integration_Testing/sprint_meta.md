## Sprint Goal

Validate the complete Auth0 integration with comprehensive testing and prepare for production deployment, ensuring the Sidebase/nuxt-auth integration works end-to-end.

## Scope & Deliverables

### Core Deliverables

1. **End-to-End Test Suite**
   - Complete login flow test (browser → Auth0 → callback)
   - API request with valid token test
   - Token expiration and 401 handling test
   - Logout flow test
   - Token refresh test

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Spring Boot JWT validation with real Auth0 tokens
   - Nuxt proxy routes with mock Auth0 responses
   - Cookie handling and security tests
   - CORS configuration validation

3. **Performance Testing**
   - JWT validation latency (<50ms target)
   - Proxy overhead measurement
   - JWKS caching effectiveness
   - Concurrent request handling

4. **Production Configuration**
   - Auth0 production tenant setup
   - Environment variable management
   - Secure cookie configuration
   - HTTPS/TLS setup

5. **Documentation & Runbooks**
   - Setup guide for new developers
   - Environment configuration checklist
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - API authentication migration guide

## Test Scenarios

### Critical Path Tests

1. **New User Flow**
   ```
   Visit App → Redirect to Auth0 → Login → Create User → Access Dashboard
   ```

2. **Returning User Flow**
   ```
   Visit App → Check Cookie → Validate Token → Access API
   ```

3. **Token Expiration Flow**
   ```
   Expired Token → 401 Response → Refresh Token → Retry Request
   ```

4. **Logout Flow**
   ```
   Click Logout → Clear Cookies → Auth0 Logout → Redirect Home
   ```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Backend
./gradlew test

# Frontend
bun test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run with test Auth0 tenant
./scripts/integration-test.sh
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
# Playwright tests
bun run test:e2e
```

## Production Checklist

### Auth0 Configuration
- [ ] Production tenant created
- [ ] Application configured with production URLs
- [ ] Refresh token rotation enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Monitoring alerts setup

### Backend Configuration
- [ ] Production JWKS URI configured
- [ ] Audience validation enabled
- [ ] CORS origins updated
- [ ] Database migrations completed
- [ ] Logging configured

### Frontend Configuration
- [ ] Production Auth0 credentials
- [ ] Secure cookie flags enabled
- [ ] Backend URL configured
- [ ] Error tracking setup

### Security Validation
- [ ] No tokens in client-side JavaScript
- [ ] httpOnly cookies verified
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] CSP headers configured
- [ ] Security headers audit

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All critical path tests passing
- [ ] Performance targets met (<50ms JWT validation)
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities found
- [ ] Production environment configured
- [ ] Documentation complete and reviewed
- [ ] Rollback plan tested
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
- [ ] Team trained on new auth flow

## Deployment Plan

### Staging Deployment (Day 1)
1. Deploy backend with dual auth support
2. Deploy frontend with feature flag
3. Test with subset of users
4. Monitor for 24 hours

### Production Deployment (Day 2)
1. Database backup
2. Deploy backend changes
3. Deploy frontend changes
4. Enable for internal users first
5. Gradual rollout to all users

### Rollback Plan
1. Feature flag to disable Auth0
2. Revert to previous auth method
3. Clear Auth0-related cookies
4. Restore from backup if needed

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- S01 completed (Backend JWT validation)
- Sidebase/nuxt-auth integration configured
- Staging environment available
- Auth0 production tenant approved

## Success Metrics

- **Authentication Success Rate**: >99.9%
- **JWT Validation Latency**: <50ms (p95)
- **Proxy Overhead**: <10ms
- **Zero Downtime**: During migration
- **User Satisfaction**: No increase in support tickets

## Sprint Tasks

### Task Breakdown
1. **T01_S02_E2E_Test_Suite** - Implement comprehensive end-to-end tests using Playwright for all authentication flows
2. **T02_S02_Integration_Tests** - Create integration test suites for backend JWT validation and frontend auth components
3. **T03_S02_Performance_Testing** - Set up performance testing framework and validate latency targets
4. **T04_S02_Production_Configuration** - Configure Auth0 production tenant and secure environment settings
5. **T05_S02_Documentation_Runbooks** - Create developer guides, troubleshooting docs, and migration playbooks

### Task Dependencies
```
T01 (E2E Tests) ─┐
                 ├─→ T04 (Production Config) ─→ T05 (Documentation)
T02 (Integration)─┤
                 │
T03 (Performance)─┘
```

## Notes

This sprint focuses on validation and production readiness. The emphasis is on:
1. **Reliability**: Comprehensive testing of all flows
2. **Performance**: Meeting latency targets
3. **Security**: No vulnerabilities or token leaks
4. **Operability**: Clear documentation and monitoring

The Sidebase/nuxt-auth integration should provide robust authentication with Auth0 while maintaining simple troubleshooting.
