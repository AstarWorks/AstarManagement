## Task Overview

Create comprehensive documentation and runbooks for the Auth0 integration to ensure smooth onboarding, operation, and troubleshooting. This task focuses on producing clear, actionable documentation that enables new developers to quickly set up the environment, understand the system configuration, and resolve common issues.

## Objectives

- Create comprehensive developer setup guide for Auth0 integration
- Document environment configuration with validated checklists
- Build troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
- Write migration guide for teams moving from other authentication systems
- Establish operational runbooks for production support

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete setup guide with step-by-step instructions and validation checkpoints
- [ ] Environment configuration checklist validated on clean system
- [ ] Common issues documented with proven solutions
- [ ] Migration guide tested with sample scenario
- [ ] Documentation reviewed by team and approved
- [ ] All guides include code examples and screenshots where appropriate
- [ ] Troubleshooting flows validated against actual issues

## Subtasks

- [ ] CORS and cookie problems
- [ ] Token refresh failures
- [ ] Network connectivity issues
- [ ] Performance troubleshooting

### 4. Migration Playbook
- [ ] Pre-migration checklist
- [ ] User data migration strategy
- [ ] Rollback procedures
- [ ] Testing migration process
- [ ] Communication templates
- [ ] Post-migration validation

### 5. Operational Runbooks
- [ ] Production deployment procedures
- [ ] Health check endpoints and monitoring
- [ ] Alert handling procedures
- [ ] Incident response workflows
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures

## Technical Guidance

Based on the codebase research, the documentation should address:

### Authentication Architecture
- Sidebase/nuxt-auth integration patterns found in frontend configuration
- Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server setup documented in backend security config
- Auth0 integration following the hybrid architecture approach
- JWT validation and claims extraction processes

### Current Configuration Files
Reference existing configuration patterns:
- `frontend/nuxt.config.ts` - Nuxt auth configuration
- `backend/src/main/kotlin/com/astarworks/astarmanagement/core/infrastructure/security/SecurityConfig.kt` - Spring Security setup
- Environment files pattern from `frontend/ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
- Database migration approach from Flyway setup

### Common Issues Identified
Document solutions for:
- JWT validation failures (found in security tests)
- CORS configuration problems (referenced in API protection tasks)
- Token refresh handling (mentioned in auth integration specs)
- Environment variable misconfigurations (common in multi-env setups)
- Database migration timing issues (found in migration analysis)

### Code Examples Structure
Include working examples for:
```
/docs/80-tasks/setup-guides/
├── developer-setup.md          # Complete setup walkthrough
├── environment-config.md       # Environment configuration reference  
├── troubleshooting.md         # Issue resolution guide
├── migration-playbook.md      # Migration procedures
└── operational-runbooks.md    # Production operations
```

### Documentation Format Standards
Follow project conventions:
- Use markdown with clear headings and structure
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Add validation checkpoints for each step
- Provide both success and failure scenarios
- Include relevant file paths and configuration examples
- Add screenshots for UI-based setup steps

### Integration Points
Document how Auth0 integrates with:
- Frontend routing and middleware (auth.ts, guest.ts patterns)
- Backend API protection (SecurityConfig, custom handlers)
- Database user management (auth0_subject references)
- Development vs production environments
- Error handling and user experience flows

## Implementation Notes

### Documentation Approach
1. **User-Centric Design**: Structure guides from the user's perspective
2. **Validation-First**: Every step includes verification commands
3. **Error-Aware**: Document what can go wrong and how to fix it
4. **Example-Rich**: Include working code samples and configurations
5. **Maintenance-Friendly**: Design for easy updates as system evolves

### Research-Based Content
Leverage findings from codebase analysis:
- Existing documentation patterns in `/docs/60-common/development/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`
- Configuration examples from Auth0 integration specs
- Error handling patterns from existing troubleshooting guides
- Security considerations from protection and validation implementations

### Quality Assurance
- Test all setup steps on clean development environment
- Validate troubleshooting solutions against actual issues
- Review with team members for completeness and accuracy
- Ensure consistency with project's technical writing standards
