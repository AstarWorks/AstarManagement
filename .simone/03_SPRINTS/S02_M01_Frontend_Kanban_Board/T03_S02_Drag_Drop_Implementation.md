# Task: Drag & Drop Implementation for Kanban Board

## Description
Implement drag-and-drop functionality for the Matter Management Kanban board using @dnd-kit/sortable. This feature will enable lawyers and clerks to intuitively update case progress by dragging matter cards between columns, with optimistic updates and error handling to ensure data consistency.

## Goal / Objectives
Enable fluid, responsive drag-and-drop interactions for matter cards across Kanban columns with:
- Smooth animations and visual feedback during drag operations
- Support for both mouse and touch interactions
- Optimistic state updates with automatic rollback on API errors
- Performance targets of <50ms drag response and 60fps animations
- Full accessibility support including keyboard navigation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] @dnd-kit/sortable is integrated and configured for the Kanban board
- [ ] Matter cards can be dragged between columns with visual feedback
- [ ] Drop zones highlight when a card is dragged over them
- [ ] Drag operations maintain 60fps performance on modern devices
- [ ] Touch interactions work smoothly on mobile devices
- [ ] Keyboard navigation allows moving cards (spacebar to pick up, arrows to move)
- [ ] Optimistic updates reflect immediately in the UI
- [ ] Failed API calls trigger automatic rollback to previous state
- [ ] Error messages display clearly when updates fail
- [ ] Drag response time is consistently under 50ms
- [ ] All existing tests pass and new tests cover drag-drop functionality

## Subtasks
- [ ] Install and configure @dnd-kit/sortable package
- [ ] Set up DndContext at the board level with proper providers
- [ ] Create draggable matter card component with drag handlers
- [ ] Implement droppable column components with drop zones
- [ ] Design and implement custom drag overlay for visual feedback
- [ ] Configure collision detection for accurate drop targeting
- [ ] Add CSS transforms and transitions for smooth animations
- [ ] Implement optimistic state updates in Zustand store
- [ ] Create rollback mechanism for failed API updates
- [ ] Add keyboard event handlers for accessibility
- [ ] Implement haptic feedback for mobile devices
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling UI
- [ ] Write unit tests for drag-drop logic
- [ ] Write integration tests for state management
- [ ] Performance testing to verify 60fps and <50ms targets
- [ ] Update documentation with drag-drop usage

## Technical Guidance
- Use @dnd-kit/sortable as specified in requirements
- Implement with performance target of <50ms drag response
- Ensure 60fps animations during drag operations
- Follow Zustand patterns for optimistic state updates
- Reference existing error handling patterns in the codebase

## Implementation Notes
- Set up DndContext at the board level
- Create custom drag overlay for visual feedback
- Implement collision detection for accurate drops
- Add keyboard support for accessibility (spacebar to pick up, arrows to move)
- Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Implement undo/rollback mechanism for failed updates
- Add haptic feedback for mobile devices
