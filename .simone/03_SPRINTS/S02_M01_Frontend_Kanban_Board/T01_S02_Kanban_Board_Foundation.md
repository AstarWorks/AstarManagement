# Task: Kanban Board Foundation

## Description
Establish the foundational structure for the Kanban board component in the AsterManagement frontend. This task focuses on creating the basic layout and column structure that will support matter progress tracking across the 7 default stages defined in the requirements. The foundation will serve as the base for future enhancements including drag-and-drop functionality, card management, and status transitions.

## Goal / Objectives
Create a robust, accessible, and performant Kanban board foundation that:
- Implements the 7 default columns as specified in R02 requirements
- Provides a responsive layout that works across different screen sizes
- Establishes a clean component architecture following Next.js 15 best practices
- Sets up the foundation for future drag-and-drop functionality
- Ensures TypeScript type safety throughout the implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Board container component created with proper layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox
- [ ] All 7 default columns implemented: Initial Consultation, Document Preparation, Client Review, Filed/Submitted, In Progress, Waiting for Response, Closed
- [ ] Responsive design that handles mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for board, column, and future card structures
- [ ] Component structure organized under src/components/kanban/
- [ ] Tailwind CSS styling applied consistently with the existing design system
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure for accessibility compliance
- [ ] Board supports horizontal scrolling when columns exceed viewport width
- [ ] Empty state placeholders in each column for visual clarity
- [ ] Unit tests written for all new components

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for board data structures
- [ ] Implement KanbanBoard container component
- [ ] Create KanbanColumn component with proper props interface
- [ ] Define column configuration with default columns
- [ ] Implement responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Add horizontal scroll container for overflow handling
- [ ] Create empty state components for columns
- [ ] Set up component file structure in src/components/kanban/
- [ ] Write unit tests for board and column components
- [ ] Add accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles)
- [ ] Document component usage and props

## Technical Guidance
- Use Next.js 15.3.3 App Router patterns
- Utilize shadcn/ui components where applicable
- Follow the existing Tailwind CSS configuration
- Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Consider the 7 default columns from requirements: Initial Consultation, Document Preparation, Client Review, Filed/Submitted, In Progress, Waiting for Response, Closed

## Implementation Notes
- Start with static column definitions that can be made configurable later
- Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for responsive column layout
- Ensure proper semantic HTML for accessibility
- Plan for virtual scrolling support for many cards
- Set up proper component structure in src/components/kanban/

### Component Architecture
```
src/components/kanban/
├── KanbanBoard.tsx         # Main board container
├── KanbanColumn.tsx        # Individual column component
├── KanbanEmptyState.tsx    # Empty state for columns
├── types.ts                # TypeScript interfaces
├── constants.ts            # Default columns configuration
└── __tests__/             # Component tests
```

### Key Considerations
- The board should be prepared to handle a large number of cards in the future
- Column widths should be consistent but allow for content flexibility
- Consider using CSS Container Queries for better responsive behavior
- Implement proper loading states for future async operations
- Use React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
