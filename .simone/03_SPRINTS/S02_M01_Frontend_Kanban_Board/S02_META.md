# Sprint: Frontend Kanban Board (S02)

## Sprint Goal
Build the interactive Kanban board UI with drag-and-drop functionality for visualizing and managing matter progress in real-time.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Kanban board layout with customizable columns
- Matter card components displaying key information
- Drag-and-drop functionality using @dnd-kit/sortable
- Real-time updates (polling initially, WebSocket optional)
- Quick filters (by lawyer, priority, search)
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- Basic mobile view with swipe navigation
- Internationalization setup (JP/EN)

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] Kanban board renders with all defined status columns
- [ ] Cards can be dragged between columns smoothly
- [ ] UI updates optimistically with rollback on error
- [ ] Responsive on desktop (>1024px) and tablet (768-1024px)
- [ ] Mobile view functional with touch gestures
- [ ] All text supports JP/EN language switching
- [ ] Component tests written for key interactions
- [ ] Visual regression tests passing
- [ ] Accessibility audit completed (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Sprint Tasks

### Foundation & Layout (Medium Complexity)
1. **T01_S02_Kanban_Board_Layout_Foundation.md** - Core board structure with 7 status columns, responsive design for desktop/tablet/mobile, component architecture and integration

2. **T02_S02_Matter_Card_Component.md** - Card display with priority color coding, lawyer avatars and temporal indicators, interactive states and accessibility

### Core Interactions (Medium Complexity)
3. **T03_S02_Drag_and_Drop_Implementation.md** - @dnd-kit/sortable integration, touch support and status validation, performance optimization for smooth animations

### User Experience Features (Low-Medium Complexity)
4. **T04_S02_Filters_and_Search.md** - Search by case number/title, lawyer and priority filtering, filter state persistence

5. **T05_S02_Real_Time_Updates.md** - Polling-based synchronization, conflict resolution and notifications, WebSocket migration preparation

6. **T06_S02_Mobile_Responsive_Design.md** - Single column mobile layout, touch gestures and swipe navigation, performance optimization for mobile

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Start with static data, then integrate with API in next sprint
- Focus on smooth animations and user experience
- Consider performance early - virtual scrolling for many cards
- Ensure proper error boundaries for graceful failures
