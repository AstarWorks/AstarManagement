# Sprint: Frontend Kanban Board (S02)

## Sprint Goal
Build the interactive Kanban board UI with drag-and-drop functionality for visualizing and managing matter progress in real-time.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Kanban board layout with customizable columns
- Matter card components displaying key information
- Drag-and-drop functionality using @dnd-kit/sortable
- Real-time updates (polling initially, WebSocket optional)
- Quick filters (by lawyer, priority, search)
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet
- Basic mobile view with swipe navigation
- Internationalization setup (JP/EN)

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- [ ] Kanban board renders with all defined status columns
- [ ] Cards can be dragged between columns smoothly
- [ ] UI updates optimistically with rollback on error
- [ ] Responsive on desktop (>1024px) and tablet (768-1024px)
- [ ] Mobile view functional with touch gestures
- [ ] All text supports JP/EN language switching
- [ ] Component tests written for key interactions
- [ ] Visual regression tests passing
- [ ] Accessibility audit completed (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Sprint Tasks

### Foundation & Components
- **T01_S02_Kanban_Board_Foundation.md** - Set up the basic Kanban board layout with 7 default columns and responsive design
- **T02_S02_Matter_Card_Component.md** - Create matter card component with priority-based styling and all required fields

### Core Functionality
- **T03_S02_Drag_Drop_Implementation.md** - Implement @dnd-kit/sortable for drag-and-drop with optimistic updates
- **T04_S02_State_Management_API_Integration.md** - Set up Zustand store and integrate with backend REST API

### Features & Enhancements
- **T05_S02_Filters_Search_Features.md** - Build quick filters (lawyer, priority) and search functionality
- **T06_S02_Real_Time_Updates.md** - Implement polling mechanism with future WebSocket support

### Responsive & Internationalization
- **T07_S02_Responsive_Mobile_Views.md** - Create responsive layouts and mobile-specific swipe navigation
- **T08_S02_Internationalization_Setup.md** - Set up next-intl for Japanese/English language support

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Start with static data, then integrate with API in next sprint
- Focus on smooth animations and user experience
- Consider performance early - virtual scrolling for many cards
- Ensure proper error boundaries for graceful failures
