# Task: Real-Time Updates for Kanban Board

## Description
Implement a polling mechanism for real-time updates in the Kanban board to ensure users see the latest changes without manual refresh. This task involves setting up the infrastructure for current polling-based updates while preparing for future WebSocket support. The implementation must handle update conflicts gracefully and provide visual indicators when data changes occur.

## Goal / Objectives
Provide users with a seamless real-time experience in the Kanban board through intelligent polling and update mechanisms.
- Implement efficient polling with configurable intervals and smart backoff strategies
- Set up infrastructure that can easily transition to WebSocket in the future
- Ensure minimal performance impact while maintaining data freshness
- Provide clear visual feedback for data updates and sync status

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Polling mechanism updates board data every 30 seconds by default
- [ ] Users can enable/disable auto-refresh via UI preference
- [ ] Visual indicators show when new updates are available
- [ ] Conflict resolution handles concurrent edits gracefully
- [ ] Exponential backoff prevents server overload during errors
- [ ] "Last updated" timestamp is visible to users
- [ ] Offline/online transitions are handled smoothly
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (< 5% CPU usage increase)
- [ ] WebSocket connection manager is prepared but not activated
- [ ] All real-time features have comprehensive test coverage

## Subtasks
- [ ] Implement polling hook with lifecycle management
- [ ] Set up ETag/timestamp-based change detection
- [ ] Create visual indicators for new updates
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff strategy
- [ ] Add user preference controls for auto-refresh
- [ ] Create WebSocket connection manager (inactive)
- [ ] Implement conflict resolution for concurrent updates
- [ ] Add "last updated" timestamp display
- [ ] Handle offline/online state transitions
- [ ] Write unit tests for polling mechanism
- [ ] Write integration tests for update flows
- [ ] Update documentation with real-time features

## Technical Guidance
- Start with polling as specified, prepare for WebSocket upgrade
- Use React hooks for polling lifecycle management
- Consider using SWR or React Query for intelligent caching
- Follow existing real-time patterns if any in codebase
- Ensure minimal performance impact

## Implementation Notes
- Implement configurable polling intervals (default 30s)
- Add visual indicators for new updates
- Use ETag or timestamp-based change detection
- Implement exponential backoff for errors
- Add user preference for auto-refresh on/off
- Prepare WebSocket connection manager for future
- Show "last updated" timestamp
- Handle offline/online state transitions gracefully
