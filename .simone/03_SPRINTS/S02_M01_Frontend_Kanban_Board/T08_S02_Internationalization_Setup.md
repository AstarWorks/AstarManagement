# Task: Internationalization Setup for Kanban Board

## Description
Set up internationalization (i18n) infrastructure for the Kanban board to support Japanese and English languages as specified in the MVP requirements. This task establishes the foundation for multi-language support using next-intl, implements translation files for all UI text, and creates a language switching mechanism that allows users to toggle between Japanese and English interfaces.

## Goal / Objectives
Establish a robust internationalization system that enables seamless language switching between Japanese and English throughout the Kanban board interface.
- Set up next-intl with Next.js 15 App Router for i18n support
- Create comprehensive translation files for all Kanban board UI elements
- Implement a user-friendly language switcher component
- Configure proper date/time formatting for both Japanese and English locales
- Ensure all user-facing text is properly externalized and translatable

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] next-intl is installed and configured with Next.js 15 App Router
- [ ] Translation files exist for both Japanese (ja) and English (en) languages
- [ ] Language switcher component is accessible and functional in the UI
- [ ] All Kanban board text (headers, buttons, labels, messages) is translatable
- [ ] Date/time displays correctly in JST for Japanese and appropriate timezone for English
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly configured for translation keys
- [ ] Browser language detection works for initial locale selection
- [ ] Selected language preference persists across sessions
- [ ] Japanese fonts render correctly across all components
- [ ] No hardcoded strings remain in the UI components

## Subtasks
- [ ] Install and configure next-intl with Next.js 15
- [ ] Set up middleware for locale detection and routing
- [ ] Create translation file structure in src/locales/{en,ja}/
- [ ] Define TypeScript types for translation keys
- [ ] Create base translation files for common UI elements
- [ ] Implement Kanban-specific translations (columns, cards, actions)
- [ ] Build language switcher component
- [ ] Configure date/time formatting utilities for both locales
- [ ] Set up font configuration for Japanese character support
- [ ] Update all existing components to use translation keys
- [ ] Create developer documentation for adding new translations
- [ ] Test with native Japanese speakers for translation quality

## Technical Guidance
- Use next-intl as specified in architecture
- Follow Next.js 15 App Router i18n patterns
- Set up proper TypeScript types for translations
- Consider using ISO 639-1 language codes (ja, en)
- Ensure proper font support for Japanese characters

## Implementation Notes
- Create translation files in src/locales/{en,ja}/
- Set up middleware for locale detection
- Implement language switcher in header/settings
- Use proper date formatting (JST for Japanese)
- Handle pluralization rules for both languages
- Set up translation keys with namespace structure
- Create developer guide for adding new translations
- Test with actual Japanese content, not machine translation
