# Task: Implement Filters and Search Features for Kanban Board

## Description
Implement comprehensive filtering and search capabilities for the Kanban board to enable users to quickly find and focus on specific matters. This includes quick filter buttons for lawyer, priority, and status, as well as search functionality for matter names and client names. The filters should provide immediate visual feedback and work seamlessly with keyboard navigation.

## Goal / Objectives
Create an intuitive and performant filtering system that helps lawyers and clerks quickly find matters they need to work on.
- Implement quick filter buttons for common filtering scenarios
- Create a responsive search interface for matter and client names
- Ensure filters provide immediate feedback with no perceivable lag
- Maintain filter state and make filters shareable via URL parameters
- Ensure full keyboard accessibility for all filter controls

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Quick filter buttons implemented for lawyer selection, priority levels, and status
- [ ] Search input provides real-time results for matter names and client names
- [ ] Search response time is under 500ms as per requirements
- [ ] Active filters are clearly indicated with count badges
- [ ] Clear all filters functionality is available
- [ ] Filters persist in URL query parameters for shareability
- [ ] All filter controls are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Filter state is managed efficiently with Zustand
- [ ] Filters work correctly with drag-and-drop operations

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create FilterBar component structure using shadcn/ui components
- [ ] Implement lawyer dropdown filter with user list from API
- [ ] Create priority toggle filters (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- [ ] Implement status multi-select filter
- [ ] Build search input with debouncing (300ms delay)
- [ ] Set up Zustand store for filter state management
- [ ] Implement URL query parameter synchronization
- [ ] Add clear all filters button with confirmation
- [ ] Create active filter count indicator
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+F for search focus)
- [ ] Add filter presets for common workflows
- [ ] Integrate Fuse.js for client-side fuzzy search
- [ ] Test filter performance with large datasets
- [ ] Add filter persistence to localStorage
- [ ] Write unit tests for filter logic
- [ ] Add E2E tests for filter interactions

## Technical Guidance
- Use shadcn/ui components for filter UI (Select, Input, Button)
- Implement with Zustand for filter state management
- Follow existing search patterns in the codebase
- Use React 19 features for optimal performance
- Ensure <500ms search response time as per requirements

## Implementation Notes
- Create FilterBar component with lawyer dropdown, priority toggles, search input
- Implement debounced search to reduce API calls
- Use URL query parameters to make filters shareable
- Add clear all filters functionality
- Show active filter count indicator
- Implement keyboard shortcuts for common filters
- Consider using Fuse.js for client-side fuzzy search
- Add filter presets for common workflows
