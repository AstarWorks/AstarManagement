# Sprint: Authentication & RBAC - Security Implementation (S06)

## Sprint Goal
Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, Discord-style RBAC system, and secure session management with mandatory 2FA support

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Spring Security configuration with OAuth2 Resource Server
- JWT token generation and validation with refresh tokens
- User authentication endpoints (login, logout, refresh)
- Discord-style RBAC implementation (Lawyer, Clerk, Client roles)
- Granular permissions system (CRUD + export + settings)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) with TOTP
- Session management with Redis
- Security audit logging for all authentication events
- Frontend authentication integration with Pinia store

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Users can successfully login with username/password
- JWT tokens are properly validated on all protected endpoints
- Refresh token rotation works correctly
- 2FA can be enabled and enforced
- Role-based access control restricts endpoints appropriately
- All security tests pass including penetration testing scenarios
- Authentication state persists across page refreshes

## Dependencies
- S05_M01_Backend_Foundation (backend infrastructure required)
- S02_M01_Frontend_Setup (for frontend integration)

## Sprint Tasks

### Backend Security Infrastructure
1. **T01_S06_Spring_Security_Configuration** (Medium) - Configure Spring Security with OAuth2 Resource Server, JWT decoder, and security filter chain
2. **T02_S06_Authentication_Service_Implementation** (Medium) - Implement core authentication service with user validation, JWT token generation, and refresh token rotation
3. **T03_S06_Authentication_API_Endpoints** (Medium) - Create REST API endpoints for login, logout, token refresh, and user profile

### Authorization & Access Control
4. **T04_S06_RBAC_System_Implementation** (High) - Implement Discord-style Role-Based Access Control with granular permissions and method-level security

### Advanced Security Features
5. **T05_S06_Two_Factor_Authentication** (Medium) - Implement TOTP-based 2FA with QR code generation and backup codes
6. **T06_S06_Session_Management_Redis** (Medium) - Implement Redis-based session management for distributed session handling

### Frontend Integration & Testing
7. **T07_S06_Frontend_Authentication_Integration** (Medium) - Integrate authentication system with Nuxt.js frontend using Pinia store and secure token handling
8. **T08_S06_Security_Testing_Hardening** (Medium) - Implement comprehensive security testing suite, rate limiting, and audit logging

## Task Dependencies
- T01 → T02, T03 (Security config foundation required)
- T02 → T04 (User service needed for RBAC)
- T01, T02, T03 → T05 (Core auth needed for 2FA)
- T02 → T06 (User sessions require auth service)
- T01, T02, T03 → T07 (Backend auth needed for frontend)
- All tasks → T08 (Testing requires complete implementation)

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Ensure tokens are stored securely in httpOnly cookies
- Implement proper CORS configuration for frontend
- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Consider implementing account lockout after failed attempts
