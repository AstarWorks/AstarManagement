# Sprint: Authentication & RBAC - Security Implementation (S06)

## Sprint Goal
Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, Discord-style RBAC system, and secure session management with mandatory 2FA support

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Spring Security configuration with OAuth2 Resource Server
- JWT token generation and validation with refresh tokens
- User authentication endpoints (login, logout, refresh)
- Discord-style RBAC implementation (Lawyer, Clerk, Client roles)
- Granular permissions system (CRUD + export + settings)
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) with TOTP
- Session management with Redis
- Security audit logging for all authentication events
- Frontend authentication integration with Pinia store

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Users can successfully login with username/password
- JWT tokens are properly validated on all protected endpoints
- Refresh token rotation works correctly
- 2FA can be enabled and enforced
- Role-based access control restricts endpoints appropriately
- All security tests pass including penetration testing scenarios
- Authentication state persists across page refreshes

## Dependencies
- S05_M01_Backend_Foundation (backend infrastructure required)
- S02_M01_Frontend_Setup (for frontend integration)

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Ensure tokens are stored securely in httpOnly cookies
- Implement proper CORS configuration for frontend
- Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Consider implementing account lockout after failed attempts
