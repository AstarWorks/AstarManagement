## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] User can log in with mock credentials and see realistic UI
- [ ] Case kanban board displays realistic legal cases with proper status flow
- [ ] Drag-and-drop functionality works smoothly on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Client list shows realistic law firm client data
- [ ] Document upload interface accepts files and shows preview
- [ ] Expense tracking allows case-related expense entry
- [ ] Document editor works with Markdown and variables
- [ ] All components are mobile-responsive (320px+ width)
- [ ] Japanese language support throughout the UI

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Nuxt 3 application builds and runs without errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes without warnings
- [ ] All components have proper Vue 3 Composition API implementation
- [ ] Pinia stores provide reactive state management
- [ ] Mock data service provides realistic legal practice data

### Storybook Requirements
- [ ] Storybook builds and runs without errors
- [ ] All major components have comprehensive stories
- [ ] Stories demonstrate different states and props
- [ ] Interactive controls work for component testing
- [ ] Visual regression testing baseline established

### Design & UX Requirements
- [ ] UI follows consistent design system (shadcn-vue)
- [ ] Japanese legal practice workflow is clearly represented
- [ ] Loading states and error states are implemented
- [ ] Accessibility standards met (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Performance targets met (<100ms component render time)

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Node.js 20+ and Bun package manager
- Nuxt 3 framework with Vue 3 Composition API
- shadcn-vue component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Pinia for state management

### Design Dependencies
- Existing design documentation in `docs/developer-guide/`
- Legal practice workflow requirements
- Japanese UI/UX conventions
- Mobile-first responsive design principles

### Data Dependencies
- Mock data representing realistic legal cases
- Sample client information (anonymized)
- Document samples for testing upload/preview
- User authentication mock data

## Risks and Mitigations

### High Risk
- **Complex Kanban Drag-and-Drop Implementation**: Use proven Vue 3 drag-and-drop libraries, start with basic implementation
- **Mobile Responsiveness Complexity**: Mobile-first approach, test on real devices early

### Medium Risk
- **Japanese Language Integration**: Plan for i18n from the start, test with actual Japanese content
- **Storybook Vue 3 Integration**: Use latest stable versions, follow official documentation

### Low Risk
- **Mock Data Realism**: Collaborate with legal professionals for realistic scenarios
- **Performance on Older Devices**: Progressive enhancement approach

## Success Metrics

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Demo can be completed in <5 minutes showing all major features
- [ ] Case drag-and-drop feels responsive (<100ms visual feedback)
- [ ] Mobile experience is fully functional on 320px+ screens
- [ ] Japanese text renders correctly throughout the application

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Application loads in <3 seconds on typical connection
- [ ] All components render without console errors
- [ ] TypeScript coverage >95% for component props and events
- [ ] Storybook stories cover >90% of component variations

### Business Value Metrics
- [ ] Legal professionals can understand the workflow immediately
- [ ] Case management concepts are clearly represented
