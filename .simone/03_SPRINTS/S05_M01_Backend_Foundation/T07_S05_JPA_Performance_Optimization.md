# Task: JPA Performance Optimization and Advanced Features

## Description
Optimize JPA performance for the Aster Management system by implementing comprehensive indexing strategies, JSONB support for flexible data storage, and full-text search capabilities. This task focuses on enhancing the existing entities with performance optimizations, creating custom repository methods with efficient queries, and implementing database-specific features for PostgreSQL including full-text search and JSONB operations.

## Goal / Objectives
- Configure comprehensive database indexes for optimal query performance
- Implement JSONB fields with proper type handling and queries
- Add full-text search support for document and matter content
- Create custom repository methods with performance-optimized queries
- Implement query projections and fetch strategies to prevent N+1 issues
- Configure Hibernate second-level cache for frequently accessed data

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-column indexes are defined for common query patterns
- [ ] JSONB fields have proper type converters and query support
- [ ] Full-text search indexes are configured for searchable content
- [ ] Repository methods use efficient queries with proper fetch joins
- [ ] Query projections are implemented for read-heavy operations
- [ ] Database execution plans show index usage for critical queries
- [ ] Hibernate statistics demonstrate improved query performance
- [ ] Second-level cache is configured for reference data
- [ ] Performance tests validate sub-200ms response times

## Subtasks
- [ ] Analyze query patterns and identify indexing opportunities
- [ ] Create multi-column indexes for Matter search queries
- [ ] Add covering indexes for frequently accessed field combinations
- [ ] Implement JSONB type converters for complex data structures
- [ ] Create JSONB query methods using native SQL
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN indexes
- [ ] Implement search methods using ts_vector and ts_query
- [ ] Create query projections for list views and summaries
- [ ] Optimize entity fetch strategies to prevent N+1 queries
- [ ] Implement batch fetching for collection associations
- [ ] Configure Hibernate second-level cache with Redis
- [ ] Add query hints for cache usage
- [ ] Create performance test suite with realistic data volumes
- [ ] Analyze query execution plans with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [ ] Document performance optimization strategies

## Technical Guidance

### Entity Design Patterns
Follow the established patterns from existing entities:
- Extend BaseEntity for automatic audit fields (id, createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy, updatedBy)
- Use UUID generation strategy for primary keys
- Implement proper equals/hashCode based on entity ID
- Apply @Table annotations with comprehensive index definitions
- Use @Column annotations with appropriate constraints

### JPA Annotations and Mappings
- Use @Entity and @Table with index definitions
- Apply @ManyToOne, @OneToMany with proper fetch strategies
- Configure @JoinColumn with foreign key constraints
- Use @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING) for enum fields
- Apply @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON) for JSONB columns

### Repository Pattern
- Extend JpaRepository<Entity, UUID> for CRUD operations
- Use @Query annotations for complex queries
- Implement method naming conventions for derived queries
- Add @Param annotations for query parameters
- Consider pagination with Pageable parameter

### Validation Constraints
- Apply Jakarta Bean Validation annotations (@NotNull, @NotBlank, @Size)
- Add custom validation messages for better error handling
- Use @Valid for nested object validation
- Implement cross-field validation where needed

### Performance Considerations
- Define multi-column indexes for common query patterns
- Use lazy fetching by default to prevent N+1 queries
- Implement fetch join queries for eager loading when needed
- Consider database-specific features (PostgreSQL JSONB, full-text search)
- Add covering indexes for frequently accessed field combinations

### Kotlin-Specific Best Practices
- Use data classes for DTOs and projections
- Leverage nullable types for optional fields
- Implement extension functions for entity operations
- Use sealed classes for state management
- Apply default parameter values where appropriate
