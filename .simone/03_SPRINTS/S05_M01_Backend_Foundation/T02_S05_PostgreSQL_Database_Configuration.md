# Task: PostgreSQL Database Configuration

## Description
Configure PostgreSQL 15 database with optimized connection pooling through HikariCP, establish database schema management with Flyway migrations, and prepare for future pgvector extension integration. The backend already has a solid foundation with existing Flyway migrations (V001-V010), HikariCP configuration in application.properties, and JPA entity mappings. This task focuses on validating and enhancing the existing configuration, ensuring optimal performance settings, and preparing the infrastructure for AI-powered vector search capabilities.

## Goal / Objectives
- Validate and optimize existing PostgreSQL 15 connection configuration with HikariCP pooling
- Review and enhance Flyway migration structure for maintainability and performance
- Prepare database infrastructure for pgvector extension (for future AI search features)
- Ensure proper transaction management and isolation levels
- Optimize database indexes based on existing query patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PostgreSQL 15 database connection is properly configured with environment-specific settings
- [ ] HikariCP connection pool is optimized for production workloads (20 max connections, proper timeouts)
- [ ] All existing Flyway migrations (V001-V010) execute successfully on fresh database
- [ ] Database performance monitoring is enabled through Spring Actuator metrics
- [ ] Transaction configuration supports proper isolation levels for concurrent operations
- [ ] Database schema documentation is generated and accessible
- [ ] pgvector extension readiness is documented with installation guide

## Subtasks
- [ ] Review and validate existing HikariCP configuration in application.properties
- [ ] Analyze connection pool metrics and adjust settings based on load patterns
- [ ] Create environment-specific database configuration profiles (dev, test, prod)
- [ ] Review all existing Flyway migrations for optimization opportunities
- [ ] Add database performance indexes based on query analysis
- [ ] Configure proper transaction isolation levels in TransactionConfig
- [ ] Create pgvector installation migration (commented out for future activation)
- [ ] Set up database connection monitoring through Actuator endpoints
- [ ] Document database schema and configuration best practices
- [ ] Create database backup and restore procedures
