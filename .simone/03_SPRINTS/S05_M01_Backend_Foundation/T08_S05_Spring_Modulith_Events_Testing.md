# Task: Implement Event-Driven Communication and Module Testing

## Description
Complete the Spring Modulith architecture by implementing comprehensive event-driven communication patterns between modules and establishing a robust module testing strategy. This builds upon the foundation and core modules already extracted, focusing on event choreography, module integration testing, and documentation generation.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement comprehensive event-driven communication between all modules
- Create event choreography patterns for complex business workflows
- Establish module integration testing patterns
- Generate complete module documentation and dependency graphs
- Verify module boundaries at compile time
- Create guidelines for future module development

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Event-driven communication is implemented for all inter-module interactions
- [ ] Event choreography handles complex workflows (e.g., matter creation with documents)
- [ ] Module integration tests verify all module boundaries
- [ ] Module documentation is automatically generated
- [ ] Dependency violation checks are integrated into the build process
- [ ] Event flow documentation is created for major use cases
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show no degradation from modularization

## Technical Guidance

### Event-Driven Architecture Patterns

#### Event Types and Conventions
1. **Domain Events**: Events that represent business state changes
   - Naming: `<Entity><Action>Event` (e.g., `MatterCreatedEvent`, `DocumentUploadedEvent`)
   - Immutable data classes with all necessary context
   - Include correlation IDs for tracing

2. **Integration Events**: Events for module communication
   - Published through Spring Modulith's `ApplicationModuleListener`
   - Asynchronous by default with configurable delivery guarantees
   - Event versioning strategy for backward compatibility

#### Event Choreography Examples
```kotlin
// Complex workflow: Matter creation with initial documents
1. UI -> MatterController.createMatter()
2. MatterModule publishes MatterCreatedEvent
3. DocumentModule listens and prepares document workspace
4. AuditModule logs the creation
5. NotificationModule sends confirmation
```

### Module Testing Strategies

#### Module Boundary Tests
```kotlin
@Modulith
class ModuleBoundaryTests {
    @Test
    fun verifyModularStructure(modules: ApplicationModules) {
        modules.verify()
    }
    
    @Test
    fun documentModuleDependencies(modules: ApplicationModules) {
        modules.module("matter").verify()
            .exposesPackage("..api..")
            .dependsOn("audit", "common")
    }
}
```

#### Integration Testing
1. **Scenario Tests**: Test complete business workflows across modules
2. **Event Publishing Tests**: Verify events are published correctly
3. **Event Handling Tests**: Ensure events are processed by listeners
4. **Module Isolation Tests**: Verify no direct dependencies

### Documentation Generation
1. **Module Structure Diagrams**: Auto-generated from code structure
2. **Event Flow Diagrams**: Document event choreography
3. **Dependency Graphs**: Visualize module relationships
4. **API Documentation**: Generate from module public APIs

### Performance Considerations
- Event processing should be asynchronous where possible
- Use event sourcing patterns for audit trail
- Implement circuit breakers for module communication
- Monitor event processing latency

## Subtasks
- [ ] Define comprehensive event catalog for all modules
- [ ] Implement event publishing infrastructure for each module
- [ ] Create event listeners for inter-module communication
- [ ] Design event choreography for complex workflows
- [ ] Implement module integration test suite
- [ ] Create module boundary verification tests
- [ ] Set up automated documentation generation
- [ ] Implement event versioning strategy
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for event processing
- [ ] Document event-driven patterns and best practices
- [ ] Implement event monitoring and tracing
- [ ] Create module dependency visualization tools
- [ ] Establish module development guidelines
- [ ] Create example microservice extraction pattern
