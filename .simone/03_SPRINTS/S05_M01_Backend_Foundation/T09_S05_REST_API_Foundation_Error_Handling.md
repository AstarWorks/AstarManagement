# Task: REST API Foundation and Error Handling

## Description
Establish comprehensive REST API foundation with consistent error handling patterns, response formatting, and OpenAPI documentation. This task builds upon the existing BaseController and GlobalExceptionHandler to create a robust API layer that supports the frontend Nuxt.js application with proper error responses, validation, and documentation.

## Goal / Objectives
- Enhance the existing base controller structure with additional helper methods for API responses
- Extend global exception handling to cover all edge cases and provide localized error messages
- Improve OpenAPI documentation with comprehensive schemas and response examples
- Establish API versioning strategy and implement it across all endpoints
- Create health check and monitoring endpoints for production readiness

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All controllers extend BaseController and use consistent response methods
- [ ] GlobalExceptionHandler covers all possible exceptions with proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Error responses follow RFC 7807 Problem Details format consistently
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation includes all error response schemas and examples
- [ ] API versioning is implemented with clear upgrade paths
- [ ] Health check endpoints provide detailed system status information
- [ ] All error messages support internationalization (Japanese/English)
- [ ] Response headers include proper CORS, security, and caching directives

## Subtasks
- [ ] Enhance BaseController with additional helper methods
  - [ ] Add paginated response helpers with metadata
  - [ ] Create bulk operation response methods
  - [ ] Implement HATEOAS link generation helpers
  - [ ] Add response caching utility methods
  
- [ ] Extend GlobalExceptionHandler coverage
  - [ ] Add handlers for concurrent modification exceptions
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting exception handling
  - [ ] Add handlers for file upload/download exceptions
  - [ ] Create custom business exception hierarchy
  - [ ] Implement exception logging with correlation IDs
  
- [ ] Improve OpenAPI documentation structure
  - [ ] Define reusable schemas for common responses
  - [ ] Add comprehensive error response examples
  - [ ] Document security schemes and requirements
  - [ ] Create operation tags for better organization
  - [ ] Add request/response examples for all endpoints
  
- [ ] Implement API versioning strategy
  - [ ] Configure URL path versioning (/api/v1, /api/v2)
  - [ ] Set up version negotiation headers
  - [ ] Create version migration documentation
  - [ ] Implement backward compatibility checks
  
- [ ] Create system health and monitoring endpoints
  - [ ] Implement /health endpoint with dependency checks
  - [ ] Create /info endpoint with build information
  - [ ] Add /metrics endpoint for Prometheus integration
  - [ ] Implement /ready and /live endpoints for Kubernetes
  
- [ ] Establish response standards
  - [ ] Define standard response envelope structure
  - [ ] Implement consistent pagination metadata
  - [ ] Create standard error code taxonomy
  - [ ] Document response header standards

## Technical Guidance
Build upon the existing patterns found in:
- `BaseController.kt` - Extend with additional response helper methods
- `GlobalExceptionHandler.kt` - Add comprehensive exception coverage
- `ErrorResponse.kt` - Ensure compliance with RFC 7807
- `OpenApiConfig.kt` - Enhance with detailed API documentation
- `MatterController.kt` - Use as reference for consistent patterns

Leverage Spring Boot features:
- Use `@RestControllerAdvice` for centralized exception handling
- Implement `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler` for Spring exceptions
- Use `@Operation` and `@ApiResponse` annotations comprehensively
- Configure `WebMvcConfigurer` for CORS and interceptors
- Utilize Spring Actuator for health and monitoring endpoints

## Implementation Notes
- Ensure all exceptions are caught and transformed into appropriate ErrorResponse objects
- Use HTTP status codes semantically (201 for creation, 204 for deletion, etc.)
- Include correlation IDs in all responses for request tracing
- Consider implementing response compression for large payloads
- Design error codes to be machine-readable and actionable
- Test error handling thoroughly with integration tests
- Document all custom headers and their purposes
