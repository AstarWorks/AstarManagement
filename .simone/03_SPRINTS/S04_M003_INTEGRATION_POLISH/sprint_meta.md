# S04_M003: Integration and Production Polish

## Sprint Goal
Complete the expense frontend implementation by integrating with backend APIs, adding dashboard widgets, optimizing performance, and ensuring production readiness with comprehensive testing and polish.

## Key Deliverables
- Full backend API integration replacing mock services
- Dashboard expense widgets and quick actions
- Performance optimization for production scale
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- E2E test suite for critical user flows
- Production deployment configuration
- User documentation and help system
- Final UI/UX polish and animations
- Security audit and fixes

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All API endpoints integrated and tested
- [ ] Authentication and authorization working
- [ ] Dashboard widgets display real-time data
- [ ] Page load times <2 seconds
- [ ] API response handling <200ms
- [ ] Error boundaries catch all failures
- [ ] E2E tests cover 10+ user scenarios
- [ ] Production build optimized (<500KB)
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] HTTPS and CSP policies in place
- [ ] User documentation complete
- [ ] Deployment pipeline configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Analytics tracking implemented

## Dependencies
- M002 backend APIs deployed and stable
- Production infrastructure ready
- SSL certificates configured
- Monitoring tools available
- Documentation templates

## Task Outline
- API integration service implementation
- Authentication flow integration
- Dashboard widget development
- Performance profiling and optimization
- E2E test scenario implementation
- Error boundary implementation
- Production build configuration
- Security audit and hardening
- Documentation writing
- Deployment pipeline setup

## Technical Considerations
- API retry logic with exponential backoff
- Request caching and deduplication
- Bundle splitting and lazy loading
- Service worker for offline support
- Proper error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
- A/B testing framework ready
- Feature flags for gradual rollout

## Notes
This final sprint transforms the expense management system from development prototype to production-ready application. Focus on reliability, performance, and user experience polish. Ensure smooth integration with existing systems and comprehensive testing before deployment. The goal is zero surprises in production.
