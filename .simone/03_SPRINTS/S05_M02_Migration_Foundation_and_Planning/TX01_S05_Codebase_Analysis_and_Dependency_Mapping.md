# Task: Complete analysis of current Next.js codebase

## Description
Analyze the entire Next.js frontend codebase to identify all React-specific patterns, dependencies, and architectural decisions that need to be migrated to Vue/Nuxt equivalents. This comprehensive analysis will serve as the foundation for planning and executing the migration from React/Next.js to Vue/Nuxt while maintaining feature parity and performance standards.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a complete inventory of all React components, their complexity levels, and interdependencies
- Map React hooks to Vue composition API equivalents for seamless migration
- Identify all npm dependencies and research Vue/Nuxt alternatives
- Document React-specific patterns (HOCs, render props, context providers, etc.)
- Create component hierarchy diagram showing parent-child relationships
- Measure and document current performance baselines for comparison

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Complete component inventory spreadsheet with complexity ratings (Simple/Medium/Complex)
- [x] React-to-Vue migration mapping document with code examples
- [x] Dependency analysis report with Vue alternatives identified
- [x] Component hierarchy diagram created and documented
- [x] Performance baseline report with Core Web Vitals metrics
- [ ] Architecture decision record (ADR) for migration strategy
- [x] Risk assessment document identifying potential challenges

## Subtasks
- [x] Analyze component structure and patterns
  - [x] Inventory all components in /frontend/src/components
  - [x] Categorize by type (UI, forms, containers, providers)
  - [x] Rate complexity based on props, state, and logic
  - [x] Document component dependencies
  
- [x] Map React patterns to Vue equivalents
  - [x] React hooks → Vue Composition API mapping
  - [x] Context API → Provide/Inject or Pinia patterns
  - [x] HOCs → Vue composables or mixins
  - [x] Render props → Scoped slots
  - [x] React.memo → Vue computed/reactive
  
- [x] Analyze state management architecture
  - [x] Document Zustand store structure
  - [x] Map to Pinia store equivalents
  - [x] Identify SSR considerations
  - [x] Document reactive data flows
  
- [x] Catalog npm dependencies
  - [x] List all React-specific packages
  - [x] Find Vue/Nuxt alternatives
  - [x] Identify packages that work with both
  - [x] Note any packages without Vue equivalents
  
- [x] Document routing and navigation
  - [x] App Router structure analysis
  - [x] Dynamic routes and params
  - [x] Middleware and guards
  - [x] API routes mapping
  
- [x] Measure performance baselines
  - [x] Lighthouse scores
  - [x] Bundle size analysis
  - [x] Runtime performance metrics
  - [x] Initial load times

## Technical Guidance

### Key Files to Analyze

1. **Package Configuration**
   - `/frontend/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
   - `/frontend/next.config.ts` - Next.js configuration
   - `/frontend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript settings

2. **Component Structure**
   - `/frontend/src/components/` - All React components
   - `/frontend/src/app/` - App Router pages
   - `/frontend/src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
   - `/frontend/src/providers/` - Context providers

3. **State Management**
   - `/frontend/src/stores/` - Zustand stores
   - `/frontend/src/stores/kanban/` - Modular store architecture
   - Performance optimized selectors

4. **API Integration**
   - `/frontend/src/services/api/` - API client and services
   - `/frontend/src/lib/api/` - API utilities
   - Authentication and error handling patterns

### Tools for Analysis

1. **Dependency Analysis**
   ```bash
   # List all dependencies
   cd frontend && npm list --depth=0
   
   # Find React-specific packages
   npm list | grep -E "(react|next)"
   
   # Analyze bundle size
   npm run build && npx @next/bundle-analyzer
   ```

2. **Component Analysis Script**
   ```bash
   # Count components by type
   find src/components -name "*.tsx" -type f | wc -l
   
   # Find hooks usage
   grep -r "use[A-Z]" src/ --include="*.tsx" | sort | uniq
   
   # Find context providers
   grep -r "createContext\|Provider" src/ --include="*.tsx"
   ```

3. **Performance Measurement**
   - Use Lighthouse CI for automated testing
   - Capture metrics with Web Vitals library
   - Document bundle sizes from build output
   - Test with throttled network conditions

### Documentation Format

1. **Component Inventory Spreadsheet**
   ```csv
   Component,Path,Type,Complexity,Dependencies,React Features,Vue Equivalent
   KanbanBoard,/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx,Container,High,"DnD Kit, Zustand",Hooks/Memo,Composition API
   ```

2. **Migration Mapping Document**
   ```markdown
   ## React Hook → Vue Composition API
   
   ### useState → ref/reactive
   ```tsx
   // React
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
   
   // Vue
   const count = ref(0)
   ```
   ```

3. **Dependency Analysis Report**
   ```markdown
   ## React-Specific Dependencies
   
   | Package | Version | Purpose | Vue Alternative | Migration Effort |
   |---------|---------|---------|-----------------|------------------|
   | @dnd-kit/core | 6.3.1 | Drag & Drop | @vueuse/draggable | Medium |
   ```

### Current Architecture Insights

Based on initial analysis:

1. **Component Architecture**
   - Heavy use of React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
   - Custom hooks for business logic
   - Context providers for global state
   - Memo optimization for performance

2. **State Management**
   - Zustand for global state with modular stores
   - Immer for immutable updates
   - SSR considerations with server snapshots
   - Performance optimized selectors

3. **UI Components**
   - Radix UI primitives for accessibility
   - Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Custom form components with React Hook Form
   - Storybook for component documentation

4. **Key Dependencies**
   - Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router
   - React 19.0.0
   - TypeScript 5.x
   - Tanstack Query for data fetching
   - Zod for validation
