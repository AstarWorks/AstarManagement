# Task: Set Up Migration Tooling and Automation

## Description
Create tools and scripts to automate parts of the React-to-Vue migration process and track progress. This involves researching and implementing automated transformation tools, building a migration progress dashboard, and establishing quality assurance mechanisms for the migrated code.

## Goal / Objectives
- Set up React-to-Vue component converter (if available)
- Create custom transformation scripts for common patterns
- Build migration progress dashboard
- Set up side-by-side comparison environment
- Create automated testing for migrated components
- Develop code quality checks for Vue code

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AST-based transformation tools are implemented for common React patterns
- [ ] Migration progress dashboard displays real-time status of component migration
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison UI allows visual verification of React vs Vue components
- [ ] Automated tests validate functional parity between React and Vue components
- [ ] Code quality checks enforce Vue 3 best practices and composition API standards
- [ ] Documentation exists for using all migration tools
- [ ] At least 3 sample components successfully migrated using the tooling

## Subtasks

### Research Phase
- [ ] Research existing React-to-Vue converters (react-to-vue, react2vue, etc.)
- [ ] Evaluate AST transformation tools (jscodeshift, ts-morph, babel)
- [ ] Investigate code comparison utilities (diff tools, visual regression testing)
- [ ] Review migration tracking systems and dashboards

### AST Transformation Setup
- [ ] Set up TypeScript AST parser for React components
- [ ] Define transformation rules for common patterns:
  - [ ] useState → ref/reactive
  - [ ] useEffect → watch/watchEffect/onMounted
  - [ ] Props interface → defineProps
  - [ ] Event handlers → Vue event syntax
  - [ ] Conditional rendering (ternary → v-if/v-show)
  - [ ] List rendering (map → v-for)
- [ ] Create custom transformer for AsterManagement-specific patterns
- [ ] Handle TypeScript type conversions

### Migration Progress Dashboard
- [ ] Design database schema for tracking:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE migration_status (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    component_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    react_loc INTEGER,
    vue_loc INTEGER,
    status VARCHAR(50), -- 'pending', 'in_progress', 'migrated', 'verified'
    migrated_at TIMESTAMP,
    migrated_by VARCHAR(100),
    test_coverage DECIMAL(5,2),
    notes TEXT
  );
  ```
- [ ] Build web dashboard showing:
  - [ ] Overall migration progress (percentage)
  - [ ] Component-by-component status
  - [ ] Lines of code metrics
  - [ ] Test coverage comparison
  - [ ] Migration timeline visualization
- [ ] Add filtering and search capabilities

### Side-by-Side Comparison Environment
- [ ] Set up dual dev server configuration (React on :3000, Vue on :3001)
- [ ] Create comparison UI with:
  - [ ] Split-screen view
  - [ ] Visual diff highlighting
  - [ ] Component behavior testing
  - [ ] Performance metrics comparison
- [ ] Implement hot-reload for both environments
- [ ] Add screenshot comparison capability

### Automated Testing Framework
- [ ] Create test generation templates for Vue components
- [ ] Set up parallel test execution for React/Vue components
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing with Playwright
- [ ] Add functional parity validation
- [ ] Create test coverage comparison reports

### Code Quality Checks
- [ ] Configure ESLint for Vue 3 + TypeScript
- [ ] Set up vue-tsc for type checking
- [ ] Add Prettier configuration for Vue SFCs
- [ ] Create custom linting rules for:
  - [ ] Composition API best practices
  - [ ] Proper ref/reactive usage
  - [ ] Event naming conventions
  - [ ] Props validation
- [ ] Integrate with pre-commit hooks

### Target Component Patterns (from /frontend/src/components)
- [ ] Form components (CreateMatterForm, EditMatterForm)
- [ ] List/Table components (with pagination, sorting)
- [ ] Modal/Dialog components
- [ ] Error boundary patterns
- [ ] Provider/Context patterns → Pinia stores
- [ ] HOC patterns → Composables
- [ ] Lazy loading components

### Documentation
- [ ] Create migration tool usage guide
- [ ] Document transformation rules and limitations
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create video tutorials for tool usage

## Technical Implementation Notes

### AST Parsing Approach
```typescript
// Example transformer structure
interface TransformationRule {
  name: string;
  detect: (node: ts.Node) => boolean;
  transform: (node: ts.Node) => string;
}

// Sample React → Vue transformation
const useStateTransform: TransformationRule = {
  name: 'useState-to-ref',
  detect: (node) => {
    // Detect useState calls
  },
  transform: (node) => {
    // Convert to ref() or reactive()
  }
};
```

### Migration Tracking
- Use PostgreSQL for progress tracking
- Expose REST API for dashboard
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Git hooks to auto-update migration status

### Quality Metrics
- Track component complexity scores
- Measure test coverage delta
- Monitor bundle size changes
- Performance benchmarks (LCP, FID, CLS)
