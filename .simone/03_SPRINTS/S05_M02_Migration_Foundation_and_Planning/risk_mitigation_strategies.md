# Risk Mitigation Strategies and Contingency Plans

## Critical Risk Mitigation Strategies

### R001: Drag-and-Drop Library Incompatibility (Score: 20)

#### Mitigation Strategy: Multi-Phase Validation
1. **Immediate Actions (Week 1)**
   - Build isolated PoC with vue-draggable-plus
   - Test all drag-and-drop scenarios from current app
   - Evaluate alternative libraries (Sortable.js, @formkit/drag-and-drop)
   - Document feature gaps

2. **Development Phase (Week 2-3)**
   - Create abstraction layer for drag operations
   - Build custom wrapper if needed
   - Implement missing features (auto-scroll, keyboard nav)
   - Performance benchmarking

3. **Validation Criteria**
   - All current drag scenarios work
   - Performance within 10% of React version
   - Accessibility features maintained
   - Mobile touch support verified

#### Contingency Plan: Custom Implementation
**Trigger:** vue-draggable-plus cannot meet requirements by Week 2
**Actions:**
1. Allocate 2 additional weeks for custom implementation
2. Hire Vue drag-and-drop specialist consultant
3. Consider hybrid approach (React DnD in iframe)
4. Re-evaluate migration timeline and budget

### R002: State Management Pattern Mismatch (Score: 16)

#### Mitigation Strategy: Incremental Store Migration
1. **Pattern Development (Week 1-2)**
   - Create Zustand-to-Pinia conversion guide
   - Build compatibility layer for gradual migration
   - Identify stores with circular dependencies
   - Redesign problematic patterns

2. **Migration Approach**
   - Start with simple, independent stores
   - Test each store migration thoroughly
   - Maintain parallel stores during transition
   - Use adapter pattern for compatibility

3. **Code Example: Compatibility Layer**
   ```typescript
   // zustand-pinia-adapter.ts
   export function createPiniaAdapter(useZustandStore) {
     return defineStore('adapted-store', () => {
       // Adapt Zustand patterns to Pinia
       const state = reactive({...})
       const getters = computed(() => {...})
       return { state, getters, actions }
     })
   }
   ```

#### Contingency Plan: Architecture Redesign
**Trigger:** Circular dependencies cannot be resolved
**Actions:**
1. Pause migration for 1 week architecture sprint
2. Redesign state management architecture
