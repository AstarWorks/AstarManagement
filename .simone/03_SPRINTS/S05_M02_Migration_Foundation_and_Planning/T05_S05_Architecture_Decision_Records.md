# Task: Create Architecture Decision Records for Migration

## Description
Document all major architectural decisions for the Next.js to Nuxt.js migration to ensure clarity and traceability. This task involves creating comprehensive Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that capture the rationale, alternatives considered, and implications of key technical decisions made during the migration process.

## Goal / Objectives
Clearly document architectural decisions to:
- Provide clear rationale for the Next.js to Nuxt.js migration
- Document library and tool selection criteria
- Define migration strategy and approach
- Establish coding standards for Vue development
- Ensure decision traceability for future reference
- Create a knowledge base for team alignment

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 6 ADRs created following standardized template
- [ ] Each ADR includes context, decision, alternatives, and consequences
- [ ] Risk assessments documented for major decisions
- [ ] Success metrics defined for each architectural change
- [ ] ADRs reviewed and approved by technical leads
- [ ] ADR index created for easy navigation

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create ADR template structure
- [ ] Write ADR-001: Next.js to Nuxt.js Migration
- [ ] Write ADR-002: shadcn-vue as Primary Component Library
- [ ] Write ADR-003: State Management with Pinia
- [ ] Write ADR-004: Migration Strategy and Phases
- [ ] Write ADR-005: Testing Framework Selection
- [ ] Write ADR-006: Build and Deployment Changes
- [ ] Create ADR index and navigation
- [ ] Review ADRs with technical team
- [ ] Publish ADRs to project documentation

## Technical Guidance

### ADR Template Structure
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue we're seeing that motivates this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Alternative 1**: Description and why it wasn't chosen
2. **Alternative 2**: Description and why it wasn't chosen

## Consequences

### Positive
- List of positive outcomes

### Negative
- List of negative outcomes or trade-offs

### Risks
- Risk 1: Description and mitigation strategy
- Risk 2: Description and mitigation strategy

## Success Metrics
- Metric 1: How we'll measure success
- Metric 2: How we'll measure success

## References

### Key Decisions to Document

#### ADR-001: Next.js to Nuxt.js Migration
**Context to include:**
- Current Next.js architecture limitations
- Vue ecosystem alignment benefits
- Team expertise considerations
- Long-term maintenance implications

**Alternatives to consider:**
- Staying with Next.js and optimizing
- Migration to other React frameworks (Remix, Vite)
- Building custom Vue framework

#### ADR-002: shadcn-vue as Primary Component Library
**Context to include:**
- Current shadcn/ui usage patterns and benefits
- Need for consistent API during migration
- shadcn-vue's Radix Vue foundation
- Tailwind CSS integration requirements
- Component customization needs

**Alternatives to consider:**
- Vuetify 3 (Material Design system)
- PrimeVue (comprehensive but different API)
- Headless UI Vue + custom styling
- Element Plus (different design language)
- Building custom component library from scratch

#### ADR-003: State Management with Pinia
**Context to include:**
- Current Zustand patterns and usage
- Vue 3 Composition API benefits
- TypeScript integration requirements
- DevTools support needs

**Alternatives to consider:**
- Vuex 5
- Valtio
- Native Vue 3 Composition API only
- Jotai-like solutions

#### ADR-004: Migration Strategy and Phases
**Context to include:**
- Business continuity requirements
- Risk mitigation approach
- Resource allocation
- Timeline constraints

**Alternatives to consider:**
- Big bang migration
- Strangler fig pattern
- Parallel development
- Module-by-module migration

#### ADR-005: Testing Framework Selection
**Context to include:**
- Current Playwright/Jest setup
- Vue testing best practices
- Component testing needs
- E2E testing requirements

**Alternatives to consider:**
- Vitest + Vue Test Utils
- Jest + Vue Test Utils
- Cypress Component Testing
- Testing Library + Playwright

#### ADR-006: Build and Deployment Changes
**Context to include:**
- Current Next.js build pipeline
- Nuxt 3 build capabilities
- Performance requirements
- CI/CD integration needs

**Alternatives to consider:**
- Vite-based build
- Webpack 5 configuration
- Turbopack integration
- Native Nuxt build

### Risk Assessments to Include

For each ADR, assess:
1. **Technical Risks**
   - Breaking changes
   - Performance impacts
   - Security implications
   - Integration challenges

2. **Operational Risks**
   - Team learning curve
   - Deployment complexity
   - Monitoring gaps
   - Support requirements

3. **Business Risks**
   - Development velocity impact
   - Time to market delays
   - Cost implications
   - User experience changes

### Success Metrics to Define

For each architectural decision:
1. **Performance Metrics**
   - Build time improvements
   - Bundle size changes
   - Runtime performance
   - Memory usage

2. **Developer Experience Metrics**
   - Time to implement features
   - Code review velocity
   - Bug resolution time
   - Onboarding time

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Feature delivery speed
   - System reliability
   - User satisfaction
   - Maintenance costs
