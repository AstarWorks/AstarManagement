# Task: Comprehensive Migration Risk Assessment

## Description
Identify, analyze, and create mitigation strategies for all risks associated with the Next.js to Nuxt.js migration. This task will establish a comprehensive risk framework to ensure the migration proceeds with minimal disruption to business operations and technical stability.

## Goal / Objectives
Develop a complete risk assessment framework for the Next.js to Nuxt.js migration that enables informed decision-making and proactive risk management.
- Identify technical risks (compatibility, performance, features)
- Assess business risks (timeline, cost, user impact)
- Evaluate operational risks (deployment, rollback, monitoring)
- Create risk mitigation strategies
- Define contingency plans
- Establish go/no-go criteria

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Technical risk assessment completed with probability and impact scores
- [ ] Business risk analysis documented with cost/timeline implications
- [ ] Operational risk evaluation finished with deployment scenarios
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies defined for all high/critical risks
- [ ] Contingency plans created for critical failure scenarios
- [ ] Go/no-go criteria established with clear decision points
- [ ] Risk monitoring framework implemented
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off obtained on risk assessment

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create risk assessment matrix template
- [ ] Identify and categorize technical risks
- [ ] Assess business and operational risks
- [ ] Score risks by probability and impact
- [ ] Develop mitigation strategies
- [ ] Define contingency plans
- [ ] Establish monitoring and trigger points
- [ ] Create go/no-go decision framework
- [ ] Review current frontend issues and performance data
- [ ] Document risk assessment findings

## Technical Guidance

### Risk Assessment Matrix Template
```markdown
| Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| R001    | Technical | Vue 3 compatibility issues | 3 | 4 | 12 | Pre-migration testing | Dev Team |
```

### Risk Categories to Assess

#### 1. Technical Complexity and Unknowns
- Framework API differences (Next.js App Router vs Nuxt 3)
- Component lifecycle differences
- State management migration (Zustand to Pinia)
- SSR/SSG implementation differences
- Build and bundle size impacts
- Performance regression risks

#### 2. Team Expertise Gaps
- Vue.js/Nuxt.js experience levels
- Training requirements
- Knowledge transfer needs
- External support requirements

#### 3. Third-party Dependency Risks
- Library compatibility (React-only libraries)
- Alternative library identification
- Feature parity assessment
- Migration effort for custom integrations

#### 4. Performance Degradation Risks
- Initial load time impacts
- Runtime performance differences
- SEO implications
- Core Web Vitals impacts

#### 5. Security Vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization migration
- CSRF/XSS protection differences
- Security header configurations
- Dependency vulnerability management

#### 6. Data Migration Risks
- Client-side state persistence
- Cache invalidation strategies
- User preference migration
- Session management

#### 7. Integration Risks with Backend
- API client compatibility
- WebSocket connections
- Authentication flow changes
- Error handling differences

### Probability and Impact Scoring
- **Probability Scale (1-5)**:
  - 1: Very Unlikely (<10%)
  - 2: Unlikely (10-30%)
  - 3: Possible (30-50%)
  - 4: Likely (50-70%)
  - 5: Very Likely (>70%)

- **Impact Scale (1-5)**:
  - 1: Minimal (Minor inconvenience)
  - 2: Low (Small delay/cost)
  - 3: Moderate (Noticeable impact)
  - 4: High (Significant disruption)
  - 5: Critical (Project failure risk)

### Mitigation Strategy Framework
1. **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by changing approach
2. **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
3. **Transfer**: Share risk with third parties
4. **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor

### Contingency Plan Structure
```markdown
## Contingency Plan: [Risk Name]
### Trigger Conditions
- Condition 1
- Condition 2

### Immediate Actions
1. Action step 1
2. Action step 2

### Recovery Process
- Recovery step 1
- Recovery step 2

### Communication Plan
- Stakeholder notifications
- Status updates
```

### Monitoring and Trigger Points
- Performance degradation > 20%
- Build failures in CI/CD
- User error rate increase > 10%
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Timeline slippage > 2 sprints

### Current Issues Reference
Review and incorporate risks from:
- Frontend error logs (React runtime errors)
- TypeScript/ESLint configuration issues
- Performance test results
- E2E test failures
- Mobile responsiveness problems
