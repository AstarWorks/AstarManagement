# Technical Risk Analysis - Next.js to Nuxt.js Migration

## Current Technical Debt Impact on Migration

Based on analysis of TX004 and TX005, the current React codebase has significant technical issues that will affect migration:

### 1. TypeScript Quality Issues
- **52 TypeScript compilation errors** blocking builds
- **234+ ESLint violations** indicating code quality issues
- **39 instances of `any` types** showing weak typing
- **Impact on Migration**: Poor type safety makes it harder to ensure correct Vue conversions

### 2. React Runtime Instabilities
- **Infinite re-render loops** in KanbanColumn component
- **Circular dependencies** in useMemo hooks
- **Improper prop forwarding** to DOM elements
- **Impact on Migration**: These patterns need careful translation to Vue's reactivity system

### 3. Component Architecture Complexity
- **Deep component nesting** in Kanban implementation
- **Complex memoization patterns** that may not translate directly
- **Tight coupling** between drag-and-drop and state management
- **Impact on Migration**: Requires architectural redesign, not just syntax conversion

## Detailed Technical Risk Categories

### Category 1: Framework-Specific Implementation Risks

#### 1.1 Drag-and-Drop System (@dnd-kit)
**Current Implementation Analysis:**
- Uses @dnd-kit's advanced features (auto-scrolling, keyboard navigation)
- Deep integration with React's synthetic event system
- Custom drag overlay implementations
- Multiple drag contexts (Kanban columns and cards)

**Migration Challenges:**
- vue-draggable-plus has different API and capabilities
- Event handling paradigm differs significantly
- Auto-scrolling behavior needs custom implementation
- Keyboard navigation may require from-scratch development

**Risk Score: 20 (Critical)**

#### 1.2 State Management Architecture (Zustand)
**Current Implementation Analysis:**
- 12+ Zustand stores with complex subscriptions
- Middleware for persistence and devtools
- Computed values using selectors
- Real-time sync between stores

**Migration Challenges:**
- Pinia's store pattern differs conceptually
- Subscription patterns need complete rewrite
- Computed properties work differently in Vue
- Store composition patterns don't map 1:1

**Risk Score: 16 (Critical)**

#### 1.3 React Hooks to Composition API
**Current Implementation Analysis:**
- 100+ custom hooks with complex dependencies
- Heavy use of useEffect with cleanup
- useMemo/useCallback optimization patterns
- Context API for cross-component communication

**Migration Challenges:**
- Effect timing differs between useEffect and watchEffect
- Dependency tracking is implicit in Vue
- Memoization patterns are different
- Provide/inject has different semantics than Context

**Risk Score: 15 (High)**

### Category 2: Performance and Optimization Risks

#### 2.1 Memoization and Re-render Optimization
**Current Issues:**
- Over-reliance on React.memo and useMemo
- Complex dependency arrays prone to errors
- Performance optimizations tightly coupled to React

**Vue Migration Impact:**
- Vue's reactivity system works differently
- May need to rethink optimization strategies
- Risk of performance regression without proper understanding

**Risk Score: 12 (High)**

#### 2.2 Bundle Size and Code Splitting
**Current State:**
- ~500KB total JS bundle
- Lazy loading implemented with React.lazy
- Dynamic imports for route-based splitting

**Migration Risks:**
- Initial dual-framework period will increase bundle
- Different code splitting patterns in Nuxt
- Risk of degraded initial load performance

**Risk Score: 9 (Medium)**

### Category 3: Type Safety and Developer Experience

#### 3.1 TypeScript Integration
**Current Problems:**
- Weak typing with 39 `any` instances
- Missing type declarations in tests
- Complex generic component types

**Migration Challenges:**
- Vue's TypeScript support has different patterns
- Generic components work differently
- Type inference for composition API requires learning

**Risk Score: 8 (Medium)**

#### 3.2 Developer Tooling and Debugging
**Current Setup:**
- React DevTools integration
- Extensive Storybook setup
- Custom ESLint rules for React

**Migration Impact:**
- Need to reconfigure all tooling for Vue
- Different debugging patterns
- Team needs to learn new tools

**Risk Score: 9 (Medium)**

### Category 4: Integration and Infrastructure Risks

#### 4.1 SSR/SSG Implementation
**Current Architecture:**
- Next.js App Router with RSC support
- Dynamic routing with catch-all routes
- API routes for BFF pattern

**Migration Challenges:**
- Nuxt 3 has different SSR paradigms
- No direct RSC equivalent
- API routes work differently

**Risk Score: 12 (High)**

#### 4.2 Testing Infrastructure
**Current State:**
- Jest + React Testing Library
- Playwright for E2E tests
- ~100 TypeScript errors in test files

**Migration Requirements:**
- Switch to Vitest for Vue components
- Rewrite all component tests
- Update E2E tests for new selectors

**Risk Score: 9 (Medium)**

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Must-Solve Before Migration
1. **Drag-and-drop library selection and PoC** (Blocks: Kanban board)
2. **State management pattern validation** (Blocks: All stateful components)
3. **SSR strategy decision** (Blocks: Production deployment)

### Can Be Solved During Migration
1. TypeScript improvements (can be iterative)
2. Testing infrastructure (can run parallel)
3. Performance optimizations (can be post-migration)

## Technical Debt Amplification

The current technical debt will amplify migration risks:

1. **Circular Dependencies**: Current React issues indicate architectural problems that will be harder to solve in Vue
2. **Type Safety**: Weak typing makes it harder to ensure correct migration
3. **Performance Patterns**: Over-optimization for React may lead to under-optimization in Vue

## Recommended Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Fix critical React bugs first (reduces migration complexity)
2. Strengthen TypeScript types (aids migration accuracy)
3. Complete drag-and-drop PoC (validates feasibility)

### Phase 2: Architecture (Week 3-4)
1. Design Vue component architecture
2. Establish state management patterns
3. Create migration utilities and codemods

### Phase 3: Implementation (Week 5-8)
1. Migrate leaf components first
2. Progress to container components
3. Tackle complex features last

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 9-10)
1. Performance tuning
2. Bundle optimization
3. Polish and bug fixes

## Quantified Risk Summary

| Technical Area | Current Issues | Migration Complexity | Combined Risk |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Drag & Drop | Working but complex | Very High | Critical (20) |
| State Management | Circular dependencies | High | Critical (16) |
| React Patterns | Memoization issues | High | High (15) |
| TypeScript | 52 errors, weak types | Medium | Medium (8) |
| Performance | Over-optimized | Medium | High (12) |
| Testing | 100+ test errors | Medium | Medium (9) |

## Conclusion

The technical risk assessment reveals that the current codebase's technical debt significantly increases migration complexity. The two critical risks (drag-and-drop and state management) require immediate proof-of-concept validation before committing to the migration. The presence of runtime errors and circular dependencies suggests architectural issues that should be addressed regardless of migration decision.
