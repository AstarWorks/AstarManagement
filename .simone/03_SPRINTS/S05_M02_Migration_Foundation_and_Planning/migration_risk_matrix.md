# Migration Risk Assessment Matrix

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Categories
- **Technical (T)**: Framework, architecture, implementation risks
- **Business (B)**: Timeline, cost, feature delivery risks  
- **Operational (O)**: Deployment, monitoring, maintenance risks
- **Security (S)**: Authentication, authorization, data protection risks
- **Performance (P)**: Speed, scalability, resource usage risks
- **Team (TM)**: Skills, knowledge, capacity risks

### Probability Scale (1-5)
1. **Very Unlikely** (<10%): Rare occurrence, requires multiple failures
2. **Unlikely** (10-30%): Could happen but not expected
3. **Possible** (30-50%): Reasonable chance of occurring
4. **Likely** (50-70%): More likely to occur than not
5. **Very Likely** (>70%): Expected to occur without intervention

### Impact Scale (1-5)
1. **Minimal**: Minor inconvenience, < 1 day delay, < $1k cost
2. **Low**: Small delay (1-3 days), < $5k cost, workaround available
3. **Moderate**: Noticeable impact (1 week), $5-20k cost, affects timeline
4. **High**: Significant disruption (2-4 weeks), $20-50k cost, feature loss
5. **Critical**: Project failure risk, > 1 month delay, > $50k cost

### Risk Score Calculation
**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**

### Risk Level Classification
- **Low (1-5)**: Monitor only
- **Medium (6-10)**: Active monitoring, mitigation planned
- **High (11-15)**: Active mitigation required
- **Critical (16-25)**: Immediate action required, consider alternatives
