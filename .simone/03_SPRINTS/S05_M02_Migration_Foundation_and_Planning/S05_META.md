# Sprint S05: Migration Foundation and Planning

## Sprint Goal

Establish a solid foundation for the Next.js to Nuxt.js migration by completing technical analysis, creating proof of concepts, selecting Vue ecosystem libraries, and documenting all architectural decisions.

## Key Deliverables

1. **Technical Spike and Analysis**
   - Complete analysis of current Next.js codebase
   - Identify all React-specific dependencies
   - Map components to Vue equivalents
   - Performance baseline measurements

2. **Proof of Concept Implementation**
   - Basic Nuxt 3 application setup
   - Sample component migrations
   - State management with Pinia
   - API integration patterns

3. **Library Selection and Evaluation**
   - UI component library selection
   - Form validation framework
   - Drag-and-drop solution
   - Testing framework setup

4. **Migration Tooling**
   - Automated component converter setup
   - Code transformation scripts
   - Migration progress tracking
   - Side-by-side comparison tools

5. **Architecture Decision Records**
   - Framework selection rationale
   - Library choices documentation
   - Migration strategy ADR
   - Risk assessment documentation

## Technical Constraints

- Must maintain API compatibility with Spring Boot backend
- Must preserve all existing functionality
- Must support SSR/SSG capabilities
- Must maintain TypeScript support
- Must be deployable to same infrastructure

## Dependencies

- Completion of M01 (Matter Management MVP)
- Backend API stability
- Team Vue.js training completion

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All PoC code reviewed and approved
- [ ] ADRs documented and reviewed
- [ ] Migration plan approved by stakeholders
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured for Nuxt
- [ ] Team trained on selected tools
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

## Risks

1. **Technical Complexity**: Some React patterns may not have direct Vue equivalents
2. **Timeline Pressure**: Migration must not impact ongoing feature development
3. **Knowledge Gap**: Team needs Vue.js expertise building
4. **Third-party Dependencies**: Some libraries may not have Vue versions

## Tasks

### Planning and Analysis
- **T01_S05_Codebase_Analysis_and_Dependency_Mapping** (Medium) - Complete analysis of current Next.js codebase
- **T06_S05_Migration_Risk_Assessment** (Low) - Comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Technical Implementation
- **T02_S05_Nuxt_3_Proof_of_Concept** (Medium) - Build representative Nuxt 3 application
- **T03_S05_Vue_Ecosystem_Library_Research** (Medium) - Research and evaluate Vue alternatives
- **T04_S05_Migration_Tooling_Setup** (Medium) - Create migration tools and automation

### Documentation
- **T05_S05_Architecture_Decision_Records** (Low) - Document all migration decisions

## Notes

This sprint focuses on planning and validation rather than production code. The goal is to de-risk the migration and ensure we have a clear path forward before beginning the actual migration work.
