# Sprint S05: Migration Foundation and Planning

## Overview

This sprint establishes the foundation for migrating the Aster Management frontend from React/Next.js to Vue 3/Nuxt.js. It focuses on technical analysis, proof of concept validation, library research, tooling setup, and comprehensive risk assessment to ensure a successful migration.

## Sprint Goals

1. **Technical Analysis Foundation**
   - Comprehensive analysis of existing React/Next.js codebase
   - Complete inventory of components and dependencies
   - Architecture pattern mapping for Vue/Nuxt migration

2. **Migration Validation**
   - Nuxt 3 proof of concept demonstrating technical feasibility  
   - Performance validation against React baseline
   - Vue ecosystem library research and evaluation

3. **Infrastructure Preparation**
   - Automated migration tooling setup
   - Risk assessment and mitigation planning
   - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documentation

## Key Deliverables

- Component inventory and dependency analysis (70+ components, 63+ dependencies)
- Working Nuxt 3 proof of concept with performance validation
- Vue ecosystem library evaluation matrix and recommendations
- Automated migration tooling and CI/CD integration
- Comprehensive risk assessment with mitigation strategies
- 10 Architecture Decision Records documenting key technical decisions

- **Description**: Establish automated migration tooling infrastructure with AST transformers, testing, and CI/CD integration
- **Key Deliverables**: Enhanced migration tools, automated testing framework, progress dashboard
- **Dependencies**: T01_S05, T03_S05

### T05_S05: Architecture Decision Records (Low - 3 points)
- **Status**: Completed
- **Description**: Create and maintain ADRs documenting key technical decisions for the migration
- **Key Deliverables**: 10 comprehensive ADR documents with migration guidance
- **Dependencies**: T01_S05, T03_S05 (recommended for complete context)

### T06_S05: Migration Risk Assessment (Medium - 6 points)
- **Status**: Ready  
- **Description**: Conduct comprehensive risk assessment with mitigation strategies for the React’Vue migration
- **Key Deliverables**: Risk register, assessment matrix, mitigation strategies, monitoring procedures
- **Dependencies**: T01_S05, T03_S05, T04_S05

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Complete component and dependency analysis covering 100% of React codebase
- [ ] Working Nuxt 3 proof of concept demonstrating superior performance (20%+ improvement)
- [ ] Vue library alternatives identified for all 63+ React dependencies  
- [ ] Automated migration tooling with comprehensive testing validation
- [ ] Risk assessment covering technical, business, and operational dimensions
- [ ] 10 Architecture Decision Records documenting all key technical choices

## Technical Considerations

### Migration Complexity
- Large codebase with 70+ React components requiring migration
- Complex drag-drop functionality (@dnd-kit ’ Vue alternatives)
- Sophisticated state management (Zustand ’ Pinia migration)
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure (Jest/RTL ’ Vitest/Vue Testing Library)

### Performance Targets
- Bundle size reduction of 20%+ through Bun and Vite optimization
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores with Nuxt 3 SSR capabilities
- Faster development build times with Vite vs webpack
- Enhanced developer experience with Vue 3 Composition API

### Risk Factors
- Team learning curve for Vue 3/Nuxt.js ecosystem
- Potential drag-drop library limitations in Vue ecosystem  
- Timeline pressure with parallel React/Vue development
- Third-party library compatibility and migration complexity

## Dependencies

- Completed M01 tasks providing stable baseline for migration
- Access to React/Next.js codebase in `frontend-nextjs-archived/`
- Existing Nuxt.js implementation in `frontend/` for enhancement
- Development environment with Bun, Node.js, and Git access

## ADR References

This sprint creates and references the following Architecture Decision Records:
- ADR-001: Frontend Framework Migration Decision
- ADR-002: State Management Solution (Pinia vs Vuex)  
- ADR-003: Component Library Selection (shadcn-vue)
- ADR-004: Testing Strategy Migration
- ADR-005: Build Tool Selection (Bun vs npm/yarn)
- ADR-006: TypeScript Configuration Strategy
- ADR-007: API Integration Pattern (TanStack Query)
- ADR-008: Routing Strategy (File-based vs Programmatic)
- ADR-009: SSR/SPA Hybrid Approach
- ADR-010: Authentication Flow Migration

## Sprint Planning Notes

### Story Points Breakdown
- **Total Points**: 39 story points
- **High Complexity**: 1 task (8 points)
- **Medium Complexity**: 4 tasks (28 points)  
- **Low Complexity**: 1 task (3 points)

### Development Approach
1. **Foundation First**: Start with T01_S05 and T05_S05 in parallel
2. **Validation Phase**: T02_S05 proof of concept with T03_S05 library research
3. **Infrastructure Setup**: T04_S05 tooling preparation
4. **Risk Management**: T06_S05 comprehensive risk assessment

### Team Allocation

## Migration Timeline

This sprint establishes the foundation for subsequent migration sprints:
- **S06**: Core Components Migration (UI library and forms)
- **S07**: Feature Migration (Kanban dashboard implementation)
- **S08**: TanStack Query Integration (advanced server state)
- **S09**: Testing and Documentation (comprehensive QA)
- **S10**: Production Deployment and Cutover (go-live)

The thorough foundation work in S05 is critical for reducing risk and accelerating subsequent sprint execution.
