# Task: Research and Evaluate Vue Ecosystem Libraries

## Description
Identify and evaluate Vue/Nuxt compatible libraries to replace current React dependencies, ensuring feature parity and performance. With shadcn-vue already selected as the primary UI component library, this research will focus on complementary libraries for drag-and-drop, form validation, and other functionality while ensuring compatibility with shadcn-vue.

## Goal / Objectives
- Find Vue alternatives for all major React libraries currently used in the project
- Evaluate each library for features, performance, and community support
- Create a comprehensive comparison matrix for decision-making
- Build small demos for critical libraries to validate functionality
- Document migration complexity for each library replacement
- Consider bundle size impact and performance implications

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All React libraries from package.json have been mapped to Vue alternatives
- [ ] Comparison matrix created with evaluation scores for each library
- [ ] Demo applications built for at least 5 critical library replacements
- [ ] Performance benchmarks completed for state management and UI component libraries
- [ ] Bundle size analysis completed comparing React vs Vue ecosystems
- [ ] Migration guide created with complexity ratings for each library
- [ ] Final recommendations document submitted with library choices

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create comprehensive list of all React dependencies from package.json
- [ ] Research Vue alternatives for UI component libraries (Radix UI replacements)
- [ ] Evaluate drag-and-drop solutions (Vue Draggable Next vs @formkit/drag-and-drop)
- [ ] Compare form validation libraries (VeeValidate vs FormKit vs Vuelidate)
- [ ] Assess state management and data fetching (Pinia + Nuxt useFetch vs React Query)
- [ ] Test icon library compatibility (Lucide Vue migration)
- [ ] Evaluate component documentation tools (Histoire vs Storybook for Vue)
- [ ] Build demo apps for critical libraries
- [ ] Perform bundle size analysis
- [ ] Create migration complexity ratings
- [ ] Write final recommendations report

## Technical Guidance

### Current React Libraries to Replace
Based on package.json analysis:
- **Radix UI (shadcn/ui)** → ✅ **shadcn-vue** (already selected - provides same component API)
- **@dnd-kit** → Vue Draggable Next, @formkit/drag-and-drop, or Sortable.js
- **React Hook Form + Zod** → VeeValidate + Zod, FormKit, or Vuelidate
- **React Query (@tanstack/react-query)** → Pinia + Nuxt useFetch, or @tanstack/vue-query
- **Lucide React** → ✅ **Lucide Vue** (bundled with shadcn-vue)
- **Storybook** → Histoire, Storybook for Vue, or Nuxt DevTools

### Evaluation Criteria Checklist
For each library, assess:
- [ ] Feature parity with React equivalent
- [ ] API similarity (ease of migration)
- [ ] TypeScript support quality
- [ ] Bundle size (minified + gzipped)
- [ ] Tree-shaking capabilities
- [ ] SSR compatibility (critical for Nuxt)
- [ ] Documentation quality
- [ ] Community size (GitHub stars, npm downloads)
- [ ] Maintenance activity (last commit, release frequency)
- [ ] License compatibility
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Accessibility features (especially for UI libraries)

### Demo Setup for Each Library
1. Create isolated Vue 3 + Vite project for each demo
2. Implement common use cases from current React app
3. Test TypeScript integration
4. Measure initial load time and runtime performance
5. Document any missing features or workarounds needed

### Performance Testing Approach
- Use Lighthouse for overall performance scores
- Measure with Vue DevTools Profiler
- Compare bundle sizes using:
  - `vite-plugin-bundle-analyzer`
  - `bundlephobia.com` for individual packages
- Test runtime performance:
  - Component render times
  - State update performance
  - Large list rendering (virtual scrolling)

### Bundle Size Analysis Tools
- **Vite Bundle Visualizer**: `rollup-plugin-visualizer`
- **Bundle Analyzer**: `vite-plugin-bundle-analyzer`
- **Size Limit**: Add to CI pipeline for monitoring
- **Bundlephobia**: Quick online checks
- Compare total bundle sizes between React and Vue setups

### Community Metrics to Check
- GitHub stars and trending status
- NPM weekly downloads trend
- Number of open issues vs closed
- Response time to issues
- Number of contributors
- Discord/Slack community size
- Stack Overflow questions/answers
- Quality of example projects

### Migration Complexity Ratings
Rate each library replacement as:
- **Low**: Direct equivalent, similar API (e.g., Lucide React → Lucide Vue, shadcn/ui → shadcn-vue)
- **Medium**: Different API but similar concepts (e.g., React Query → Pinia)
- **High**: Significant architectural differences requiring major refactoring

### Additional Considerations
- Nuxt 3 module ecosystem compatibility
- Auto-import support for better DX
- Composition API patterns vs React Hooks
- Vue 3 Suspense support for async components
- Pinia devtools integration
- TypeScript generic component support
- Integration with shadcn-vue component system
- Maintaining consistent styling with Tailwind CSS utilities
