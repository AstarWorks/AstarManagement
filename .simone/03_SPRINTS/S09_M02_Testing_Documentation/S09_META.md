## Scope & Key Deliverables

- Unit testing setup with Vitest and Vue Test Utils
- Integration testing for complex workflows
- E2E testing with Playwright for critical paths
- Visual regression testing with Storybook
- Performance testing and benchmarking
- Comprehensive developer documentation
- Migration guide from Next.js to Nuxt.js
- API documentation and type definitions

### Total Story Points: 71

## Technical Constraints

- Tests must run in both Node.js and browser environments
- Maintain compatibility with CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation must follow ADR format where applicable
- Visual tests must work cross-browser
- Performance tests must establish baselines

## Dependencies

- Completed S08 TanStack Query integration
- All previous sprint deliverables
- Access to staging environment for E2E tests
- Design system documentation

## Required ADRs

- **ADR-001-S09**: Testing Strategy and Tool Selection
- **ADR-002-S09**: Documentation Standards and Tooling
- **ADR-003-S09**: Performance Benchmark Criteria
- **ADR-004-S09**: Visual Regression Testing Approach

## Risk Factors

- Test flakiness in E2E scenarios
- Documentation drift over time
- Performance regression detection accuracy
- Cross-browser visual test complexity
- Knowledge transfer effectiveness

## Success Metrics

- Code coverage: >80% for unit tests
- E2E test reliability: >95% success rate
- Documentation completeness: 100% API coverage
- Performance: No regressions from baseline
- Team confidence: Positive feedback on docs

## Notes

- Prioritize testing for business-critical paths
- Use snapshot testing judiciously
- Document testing patterns for consistency
- Create runbooks for common scenarios
- Plan for ongoing documentation updates
