- **Dependencies**: ["T01_S09_Unit_Testing_Setup"]

## Goal

Establish comprehensive visual regression testing infrastructure using Storybook and Playwright to automatically detect visual changes in UI components, ensuring consistent design implementation and preventing visual bugs from reaching production.

## Description

This task involves enhancing and completing the visual regression testing system for the Nuxt.js frontend components. The goal is to create automated visual tests that capture screenshots of components in various states and compare them against established baselines to detect unintended visual changes.

The visual testing system should cover all UI components, responsive breakpoints, theme variations, and component states to ensure visual consistency across the application. This is particularly important for the legal case management system where UI consistency and reliability are crucial for user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete visual regression testing setup with Storybook and Playwright
- [ ] Visual test baselines for all major UI components (buttons, forms, cards, modals)
- [ ] Visual tests for responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Visual tests for theme variations (light/dark, legal themes)
- [ ] Visual tests for component states (loading, error, disabled, hover)
- [ ] Cross-browser visual testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Visual diff reporting with clear failure explanations
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline for automated visual checks
- [ ] Documentation for maintaining visual test baselines
- [ ] Performance optimization for visual test execution
- [ ] Visual regression testing achieves >95% component coverage
- [ ] Visual tests complete in <10 minutes for full suite

## Technical Guidance

### Testing Strategy

#### Visual Test Categories

1. **Component Visual Tests**
   - All shadcn-vue UI components (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.)
   - Form components with various validation states
   - Kanban components in different configurations
   - Legal-specific components (matter cards, case timelines)

2. **Layout Visual Tests**
   - Page layouts (dashboard, matter details, settings)
   - Navigation components (sidebar, header, breadcrumbs)
   - Responsive layout breakpoints
   - Print styles for legal documents

3. **Interaction State Tests**
   - Hover, focus, and active states
   - Loading and skeleton states
   - Error and empty states
   - Success and confirmation states

4. **Theme and Accessibility Tests**
   - Light and dark theme variations
   - High contrast mode
   - Different color schemes for legal contexts
   - Font size variations

### Implementation Requirements

#### Storybook Story Coverage
- Ensure all components have comprehensive stories
- Include all visual states and variations
- Add interaction tests for dynamic components
- Document expected visual behavior

#### Cross-Browser Testing
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

#### Responsive Testing
- Mobile (375px)
- Tablet (768px)
- Desktop (1024px)
- Large desktop (1440px)

#### Performance Requirements
- Visual test suite must complete in <10 minutes
- Individual component tests should run in <30 seconds
- Baseline images should be optimized for size
- Parallel test execution for faster feedback

## Subtasks

- [ ] Audit existing visual test infrastructure and identify gaps
- [ ] Enhance Storybook stories for comprehensive visual coverage
- [ ] Implement cross-browser visual testing configuration
- [ ] Create visual test baselines for all major components
- [ ] Set up responsive breakpoint testing
- [ ] Implement theme variation testing (light/dark)
- [ ] Configure visual diff reporting and failure analysis
- [ ] Optimize visual test performance and execution time
- [ ] Integrate visual tests into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create documentation for visual test maintenance
- [ ] Add visual regression testing for legal-specific workflows
- [ ] Implement automated baseline update workflows
