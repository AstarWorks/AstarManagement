## Description
Implement comprehensive end-to-end testing with Playwright for critical user workflows in the legal case management system. Focus on testing complete user journeys from authentication through case management operations, ensuring the system works correctly from a user's perspective.

## Parent: S09_M02_Testing_Documentation

## Technical Guidance

### E2E Testing Scope
- **User Authentication**: Login/logout workflows with role-based access
- **Case Management**: Complete CRUD operations for legal matters
- **Kanban Workflows**: Drag-and-drop operations and status transitions
- **Form Interactions**: Complex form validation and submission
- **Real-time Features**: Live updates and collaborative operations
- **Responsive Design**: Cross-device compatibility testing

### Testing Strategy
- **Page Object Model**: Structured approach for maintainable tests
- **Test Data Management**: Isolated test data for each scenario
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari compatibility
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design validation
- **Performance Testing**: Core Web Vitals and loading metrics

### Critical User Journeys
- **Lawyer Workflow**: Login → Create Matter → Update Status → Add Documents
- **Clerk Workflow**: Login → View Cases → Update Details → Generate Reports
- **Client Workflow**: Login → View Assigned Cases → Review Updates
- **Collaborative Workflow**: Multiple users working on same case

## Implementation Notes

### Playwright Setup
- Configure Playwright with TypeScript support
- Set up test environments (development, staging)
- Configure cross-browser testing matrix
- Set up visual comparison testing
- Configure CI/CD integration

### Test Organization
- Group tests by user role and workflow
- Create shared utilities for common operations
- Implement test data factories and fixtures
- Set up test reporting and screenshots
- Configure test parallelization

### Performance Testing
- Core Web Vitals measurement
- Page load performance baselines
- API response time validation
- Bundle size monitoring
- Memory usage tracking

## Tasks
