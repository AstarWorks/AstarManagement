# T02_S09 Integration Testing

## Status: completed
## Assignee: Claude  
## Updated: 2025-06-26 08:55
## Priority: high
## Complexity: medium
## Story Points: 8
## Created: 2025-06-26
## Dependencies: ["T01_S09"]

## Description
Implement comprehensive integration testing for Pinia stores, TanStack Query integration, and complex component workflows. Focus on testing data flow, state management, and cross-component interactions in the legal case management system.

## Parent: S09_M02_Testing_Documentation

## Technical Guidance

### Integration Testing Scope
- **Store Integration**: Pinia store interactions with TanStack Query
- **Component Integration**: Multi-component workflows (Kanban drag-and-drop)
- **API Integration**: Server state synchronization and error handling
- **Real-time Integration**: WebSocket connections and live updates

### Testing Patterns
- **Store-to-Store Communication**: Cross-store dependencies and interactions
- **Component-Store Integration**: Vue components with Pinia store integration
- **Query-Store Integration**: TanStack Query cache with Pinia state
- **Error Propagation**: Error handling across component boundaries

### Mock Strategy
- **Partial Mocking**: Mock external dependencies while testing integration points
- **Service Layer Mocking**: Mock API calls but test store logic
- **Timer Mocking**: Control time-dependent integrations (polling, debouncing)
- **Event Mocking**: WebSocket and custom event integration

## Implementation Notes

### Store Integration Testing
- Test Pinia store compositions and cross-store dependencies
- Verify TanStack Query cache integration with store state
- Test optimistic updates and rollback scenarios
- Validate store persistence and hydration

### Component Workflow Testing
- Multi-step user interactions (drag-and-drop workflows)
- Form submission with validation and API integration
- Real-time updates affecting multiple components
- Error states propagating through component tree

### API Integration Testing
- Server state synchronization patterns
- Offline/online state handling
- Request queuing and retry logic
- Cache invalidation cascades

## Tasks
- [x] Set up integration test environment
- [x] Test Pinia store interactions
- [x] Test TanStack Query integration with stores
- [x] Test Kanban drag-and-drop workflow
- [x] Test form submission workflows
- [x] Test real-time update integration
- [x] Test error handling and propagation
- [x] Test offline/online state transitions
- [x] Test cache invalidation patterns
- [x] Document integration testing patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Store-to-store interactions work correctly
- [x] TanStack Query integrates properly with Pinia
- [x] Complex workflows (drag-and-drop) function end-to-end
- [x] Error states propagate correctly through components
- [x] Real-time updates work across component boundaries
- [x] Offline/online transitions handle gracefully
- [x] Cache invalidation cascades work as expected
- [x] Integration tests are reliable and fast
- [x] Test patterns are documented for team use
- [x] Integration tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Constraints
- Tests must complete within 30 seconds
- Use real Vue components with mocked external dependencies
- Maintain test isolation between integration tests
- Support both online and offline testing scenarios

## Definition of Done
