## Description
Configure comprehensive unit testing infrastructure for the Nuxt.js frontend using Vitest and Vue Test Utils. Establish testing patterns, utilities, and CI integration for component and composable testing.

## Parent: S09_M02_Testing_Documentation

## Technical Guidance

### Testing Framework Selection
- **Vitest**: Fast, Vite-native test runner with excellent Vue 3 support
- **Vue Test Utils**: Official Vue.js testing utility library for component testing
- **@vue/test-utils**: Vue 3 compatible version for Composition API testing
- **Testing Library**: Consider @testing-library/vue for user-centric testing approach

### Test Environment Configuration
- Node.js environment for composables and utilities
- jsdom environment for component DOM testing
- TypeScript support with proper type checking
- Mock configuration for Nuxt auto-imports and modules

### Coverage and Reporting
- Code coverage reporting with c8/v8 coverage
- HTML reports for detailed coverage analysis
- CI/CD integration with coverage thresholds
- Component and composable specific coverage targets

## Implementation Notes

### Vitest Configuration Strategy
- Nuxt-specific configuration for auto-imports
- Proper handling of Vue SFC components
- Mock configuration for external dependencies
- Test environment setup for different test types

### Component Testing Patterns
- Shallow vs deep mounting strategies
- Props and emit testing patterns
- Composition API testing approaches
- Store integration testing with Pinia

### Test Organization
- Co-located tests with components (`__tests__` directories)
- Shared test utilities and fixtures
- Mock data and factory patterns
- Test setup and teardown helpers

## Tasks
- [x] Install and configure Vitest with Nuxt 3
- [x] Set up Vue Test Utils for component testing
- [x] Configure TypeScript support for tests
- [x] Create test utilities and helpers
- [x] Set up coverage reporting
- [x] Write example component tests
- [x] Configure CI/CD integration
- [x] Document testing patterns and conventions
- [x] Create test data factories and fixtures
- [x] Set up mock configurations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Vitest runs successfully in Nuxt 3 environment
- [x] Vue components can be mounted and tested
- [x] TypeScript tests compile without errors
- [x] Code coverage reports are generated
- [x] Example tests demonstrate patterns
- [x] CI/CD pipeline runs tests automatically
- [x] Documentation covers testing workflow
- [x] Mock configurations work for external deps
- [x] Test utilities simplify common scenarios
- [x] Coverage thresholds are enforced

## Technical Constraints
- Must work with Nuxt 3 auto-imports
- Compatible with Vue 3 Composition API
- Support for TypeScript throughout
- Minimal test environment setup time
- Reliable test execution in CI/CD

## Definition of Done
- [x] Vitest configuration complete and tested
- [x] Vue Test Utils working with all component types
- [x] TypeScript support fully functional
- [x] Coverage reporting configured and working
- [x] At least 3 example component tests written
- [x] CI/CD integration verified
- [x] Testing documentation complete
- [x] Mock patterns established
- [x] Test utilities created and documented
- [x] Team can write and run tests successfully
