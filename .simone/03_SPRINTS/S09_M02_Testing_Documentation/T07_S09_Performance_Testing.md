## Goal

Establish comprehensive performance testing infrastructure for the Nuxt.js frontend, create performance benchmarks, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimization strategies to ensure the application meets or exceeds performance requirements.

## Description

This task involves setting up performance testing tools, creating benchmarks for critical user paths, measuring Core Web Vitals, and implementing performance optimizations. The goal is to ensure the Nuxt.js migration maintains or improves upon the performance characteristics of the original Next.js application.

- [ ] Server-side rendering (SSR) performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Core Web Vitals meet targets (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)
- [ ] Memory leak detection and prevention tests implemented
- [ ] API response time monitoring integrated
- [ ] Performance regression tests in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent users (100+ simultaneous)
- [ ] Performance optimization recommendations documented
- [ ] Before/after performance comparison report generated

## Technical Guidance

### Current Performance Infrastructure

The Nuxt.js POC has several performance considerations already in place:

1. **Build Configuration**
   - Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
   - Code splitting and lazy loading configured
   - Tree shaking for unused code elimination

2. **SSR Optimization**
   - Nuxt 3's built-in SSR capabilities
   - Component-level caching potential
   - API route optimization

3. **State Management**
   - Pinia stores with minimal reactivity overhead
   - TanStack Query for efficient server state caching

### Performance Testing Tools

#### 1. Lighthouse CI
- Automated performance audits in CI/CD
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Performance budget enforcement

#### 2. Bundle Analysis
- `@nuxt/analyze` for bundle visualization
- Webpack Bundle Analyzer integration
- Identification of large dependencies

#### 3. Runtime Performance
- Vue DevTools performance profiling
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Custom performance markers

#### 4. Load Testing
- k6 for load testing scenarios
- Artillery for API endpoint testing
- Concurrent user simulation

### Key Performance Metrics

1. **Core Web Vitals**
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   - First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

2. **Additional Metrics**
   - Time to First Byte (TTFB)
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Time to Interactive (TTI)
   - Total Blocking Time (TBT)

3. **Application-Specific Metrics**
   - Kanban board initial render time
   - Drag-and-drop operation latency
   - Form validation response time
   - Search and filter performance

### Performance Optimization Strategies

1. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Code splitting by route
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components
   - External library optimization
   - Asset optimization (images, fonts)

2. **Runtime Optimization**
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Debouncing and throttling
   - Memoization of expensive computations
   - Efficient re-render strategies

3. **Network Optimization**
   - HTTP/2 push for critical resources
   - Prefetching and preloading
   - Service worker caching
   - API response compression
