## Task Details
- **Task ID**: T09_S09
- **Title**: Migration Guide
- **Description**: Create comprehensive migration guide from Next.js to Nuxt.js for the Aster Management frontend
- **Status**: completed
- **Assignee**: Claude
- **Updated**: 2025-06-26 12:46
- **Created_date**: 2025-06-26
- **Priority**: medium
- **Complexity**: medium
- **Estimated Time**: 14 hours
- **Story Points**: 7
- **Tags**: [documentation, migration, next-js, nuxt-js, guide, architecture]
- **Dependencies**: [T08_S09_Developer_Documentation]

## Goal

Create a comprehensive migration guide that documents the process, patterns, and decisions involved in migrating from Next.js to Nuxt.js, enabling future migration efforts and providing insights into architectural differences and best practices.

## Description

This task involves creating detailed documentation of the Next.js to Nuxt.js migration process for the Aster Management frontend. The guide should cover architectural differences, component migration patterns, state management changes, routing updates, and deployment considerations. It should serve as both a historical record and a practical guide for similar migrations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Architecture comparison between Next.js and Nuxt.js approaches
- [x] Component migration patterns and examples
- [x] State management migration (Zustand to Pinia, TanStack Query integration)
- [x] Routing migration guide (Next.js App Router to Nuxt.js file-based routing)
- [x] TypeScript configuration and setup differences
- [x] Build and deployment process changes
- [x] Performance considerations and optimizations
- [x] Testing approach migration
- [x] Development workflow changes
- [x] Common pitfalls and troubleshooting
- [x] Migration checklist and timeline estimates
- [x] Code examples and side-by-side comparisons
- [x] Lessons learned and recommendations

## Technical Guidance

### Migration Guide Structure

The migration guide should be organized into logical sections:

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Migration overview and key benefits
   - Timeline and effort estimation
   - Key architectural changes

2. **Pre-Migration Analysis**
   - Codebase assessment methodology
   - Dependency mapping
   - Risk assessment framework

3. **Architecture Changes**
   - Framework comparison (Next.js vs Nuxt.js)
   - File structure differences
   - Rendering strategies (SSR, SSG, SPA)
   - Build system changes

4. **Component Migration**
   - JSX to Vue SFC conversion patterns
   - Props and event handling changes
   - Styling migration (CSS Modules to scoped styles)
   - Component library changes (shadcn/ui to shadcn-vue)

5. **State Management Migration**
   - Zustand to Pinia migration patterns
   - TanStack Query integration differences
   - Context to provide/inject patterns

6. **Routing Migration**
   - Next.js App Router to Nuxt.js pages
   - Dynamic routing patterns
   - Middleware migration
   - Navigation pattern changes

7. **Development Experience**
   - Tooling changes (Webpack to Vite)
   - Development server differences
   - Hot reload and debugging
   - TypeScript integration

8. **Testing Migration**
   - Test framework changes
   - Component testing patterns
   - E2E testing setup differences
   - Mock and fixture patterns

9. **Deployment and CI/CD**
   - Build process changes
   - Environment configuration
   - Deployment target differences
   - Performance monitoring

10. **Best Practices and Lessons Learned**
    - Migration methodology
    - Common pitfalls
    - Performance considerations
    - Team onboarding

### Key Topics to Cover

1. **Framework Comparison**
   - Ecosystem differences
   - Community and support
   - Performance characteristics
   - Development experience

2. **Migration Strategies**
   - Big bang vs incremental migration
   - Feature flagging approach
   - Rollback procedures
   - Testing strategies

3. **Technical Patterns**
   - Component conversion patterns
   - State management patterns
   - API integration patterns
   - Authentication patterns

4. **Tooling Migration**
   - Build tool differences
   - Development environment setup
   - IDE configuration
   - Debugging tools

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Bundle size optimization
   - Runtime performance
   - SEO implications
   - Core Web Vitals
