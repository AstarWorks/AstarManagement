# Task: Table View Advanced Features

## Description
Enhance the basic table view with advanced features including inline editing capabilities, bulk operations, and additional productivity features. This builds upon the basic table implementation to provide power users with efficient data manipulation tools while maintaining consistency with the Kanban board view.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement inline editing for common fields (title, status, priority, assignee)
- Support bulk operations (select multiple matters, batch status updates)
- Add export functionality and advanced filtering
- Ensure smooth user experience with optimistic updates
- Maintain accessibility standards for all interactive features

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Inline editing works smoothly with optimistic updates
- [ ] Bulk selection and operations are intuitive and performant
- [ ] Export to CSV functionality works correctly
- [ ] Advanced filtering options are available
- [ ] Conflict resolution handles concurrent edits gracefully
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- [ ] All features work consistently across supported browsers

## Subtasks
- [ ] Add inline editing capabilities
  - [ ] Create editable cell components for each data type
  - [ ] Implement focus management and keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Add validation and error handling
  - [ ] Support escape to cancel, enter to save

- [ ] Implement bulk operations
  - [ ] Add row selection with checkboxes
  - [ ] Create bulk action toolbar
  - [ ] Implement batch status update
  - [ ] Add bulk delete with confirmation
  - [ ] Support select all/none/inverse

- [ ] Add advanced table features
  - [ ] Export to CSV functionality
  - [ ] Print-friendly view
  - [ ] Advanced column filters
  - [ ] Custom filter combinations

- [ ] Enhance inline editing experience
  - [ ] Add debouncing for inline edits
  - [ ] Implement undo/redo functionality
  - [ ] Show save indicators
  - [ ] Handle validation errors gracefully

- [ ] Handle concurrent editing
  - [ ] Implement conflict detection
  - [ ] Create conflict resolution UI
  - [ ] Show other users' active edits
  - [ ] Add optimistic locking

- [ ] Add comprehensive testing
  - [ ] Unit tests for inline editing
  - [ ] Integration tests for bulk operations
  - [ ] E2E tests for user workflows
  - [ ] Accessibility audits
  - [ ] Browser compatibility tests

## Technical Guidance

### Inline Editing Architecture
- Create reusable `EditableCell` components for different data types
- Use Vue's v-model for two-way binding
- Implement proper focus management with `@focus` and `@blur` events
- Debounce API calls to reduce server load

### Bulk Operations Implementation
- Use Set data structure for efficient selection tracking
- Implement batch API endpoints for bulk updates
- Show progress indicators for long-running operations
- Use optimistic updates with rollback on failure

### Export Functionality
- Generate CSV on client-side for better performance
- Include all visible columns in export
- Handle special characters and encoding properly
- Provide options for filtered vs. all data export

### Conflict Resolution
- Implement version tracking for optimistic locking
- Show real-time indicators when others are editing
- Provide merge UI for conflicting changes
- Use WebSocket events for live collaboration features

### Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide proper ARIA labels for bulk operations
- Announce state changes to screen readers
- Support keyboard shortcuts for common actions
