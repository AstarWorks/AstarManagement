# Task: Matter Activity Timeline

## Description
Create Vue 3 components for displaying matter documents, communications, and activity timeline. These components will provide a comprehensive view of all matter-related activities, including document uploads, email communications, notes, and audit events. The timeline will help lawyers track case progress and maintain a complete history of all interactions and changes.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement document list component with categorization and quick actions
- Build communication history component showing emails, notes, and client interactions
- Develop activity timeline component for audit trail and real-time updates
- Create a unified view that combines all matter activities chronologically
- Ensure components support real-time synchronization and offline capabilities
- Provide filtering and search capabilities within activity feeds

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document list supports categorization, sorting, and filtering by type/date
- [ ] Communication history shows all interaction types with proper threading
- [ ] Activity timeline displays audit events in chronological order
- [ ] Timeline supports filtering by activity type, user, and date range
- [ ] Components handle pagination for large data sets
- [ ] Real-time updates appear in timeline without page refresh
- [ ] Offline actions are queued and synced when connection restored
- [ ] Components are responsive with mobile-optimized views
- [ ] Search functionality works across all activity types
- [ ] Export functionality available for activity reports

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create MatterDocumentList component with document categorization
- [ ] Build MatterCommunicationHistory component for emails and notes
- [ ] Implement MatterActivityTimeline component consuming audit events
- [ ] Develop ActivityTimelineItem component for consistent rendering
- [ ] Create MatterDetailTabs component to organize all panels
- [ ] Add filtering and search UI components for timeline
- [ ] Implement infinite scroll or pagination for long timelines
- [ ] Add real-time update integration using WebSocket patterns
- [ ] Create loading states and empty states for each component
- [ ] Write Storybook stories demonstrating various activity types
- [ ] Implement unit tests for timeline logic and filtering
- [ ] Add export functionality for activity reports

## Technical Guidance

### Component Architecture
- Use Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript
- Implement virtual scrolling for performance with long lists
- Use TanStack Query's `useInfiniteQuery` for pagination
- Leverage existing WebSocket patterns for real-time updates

### Data Fetching Strategy
- Create separate query composables for documents, communications, and activities
- Implement proper query key hierarchy for cache invalidation
- Use optimistic updates for user actions
- Handle offline queue integration for mutations

### Timeline Implementation
- Use a unified data structure for all activity types
- Implement proper sorting and grouping by date
- Support both compact and detailed view modes
- Handle timezone conversions properly

### Performance Optimization
- Implement virtual scrolling for long activity lists
- Lazy load document previews and attachments
- Use proper memoization for filtered results
- Progressive loading for initial page render

### Mobile Considerations
- Swipe gestures for timeline navigation
- Condensed view for mobile screens
- Touch-friendly action buttons
- Optimized data loading for mobile networks

## Implementation Notes
- Activity timeline should support multiple view modes (compact, detailed, grouped by day)
- Document list should prepare for future document viewer integration
- Communication entries should support inline replies/notes
- Consider implementing keyboard shortcuts for timeline navigation
- Timeline filtering should update URL for shareable views
- Export should support multiple formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)
- Consider implementing activity notifications for important events
- Ensure audit trail cannot be modified or deleted
