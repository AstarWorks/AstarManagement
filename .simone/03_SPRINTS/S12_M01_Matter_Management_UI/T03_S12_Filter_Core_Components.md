# Task: Filter Core Components

## Description
Build the foundational filter components and state management for the matter management interface. This task focuses on creating filter controls for all matter fields (case number, client name, opponent name, assigned lawyer/clerk, status, priority, due date range, tags) and implementing basic filter state persistence across sessions.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create reusable filter components for all matter fields
- Implement filter state management with Pinia
- Ensure filter state persistence using localStorage
- Build a responsive filter panel with clear visual hierarchy
- Support basic search functionality with debouncing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Filter panel includes controls for all matter fields (case number, client, opponent, lawyers, clerks, status, priority, dates, tags)
- [ ] Date range picker supports flexible date selections with basic presets (this week, last month, etc.)
- [ ] Multi-select dropdowns implemented for lawyers, clerks, status, priority, and tags
- [ ] Filter state persists across page refreshes using localStorage
- [ ] Applied filters show visual count badges and clear summary
- [ ] "Clear all" and individual filter removal options available
- [ ] Basic search functionality with debounced input
- [ ] Performance optimized with debounced filter applications
- [ ] Keyboard navigation supported for all filter controls
- [ ] Screen reader accessible with proper ARIA labels

## Subtasks
### Core Filter Components
- [ ] Enhance existing FilterBar.vue to support all matter fields
- [ ] Create date range picker component with preset options
- [ ] Implement multi-select components for lawyers, clerks, and tags
- [ ] Add opponent name search field
- [ ] Create case number search field with validation

### State Management & Persistence
- [ ] Extend useFilterPersistence composable to handle all new fields
- [ ] Update FilterState interface in types/matter.ts with new fields
- [ ] Implement basic filter state serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Integrate with existing Pinia store for real-time updates
- [ ] Add filter change event handling

### UI/UX Foundation
- [ ] Design clear visual hierarchy for filter groups
- [ ] Add loading states during filter application
- [ ] Create empty state messaging when no results
- [ ] Implement filter count badges
- [ ] Add clear filter functionality per field and globally

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write unit tests for filter logic and state management
- [ ] Create Storybook stories for individual filter components
- [ ] Document filter component APIs
- [ ] Add integration tests for filter persistence

## Technical Guidance
- Build upon the existing FilterBar.vue component architecture
- Leverage FormDatePicker.vue and other form components from the forms directory
- Utilize the useFilterPersistence composable pattern for state management
- Follow the established Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Use shadcn-vue components for consistent UI design
- Implement with TypeScript for type safety
- Ensure compatibility with the existing Kanban board filtering system

## Implementation Notes
- The current FilterBar.vue already handles lawyers, priorities, and statuses - extend this pattern
- FilterState interface should include: caseNumber, clientName, opponentName, lawyers[], clerks[], statuses[], priorities[], dateRange, tags[]
- Use existing FormSelect and FormDatePicker components as base
- Ensure filter changes are debounced to prevent excessive API calls
- Consider component composition for reusability
