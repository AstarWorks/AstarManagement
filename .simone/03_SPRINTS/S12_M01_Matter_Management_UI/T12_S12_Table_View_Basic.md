# Task: Table View Basic Implementation

## Description
Implement a basic table view for matter management as an alternative to the Kanban board. This table view should provide a compact, data-dense interface with virtualization support for handling large datasets efficiently. The implementation should share the same underlying state management with the Kanban board, ensuring data consistency across views.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a performant table view component that serves as an alternative to the Kanban board
- Share state management between table and Kanban views for seamless switching
- Optimize for large datasets with virtualization
- Implement basic sorting and column configuration
- Maintain real-time updates consistency between views

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Table view displays all matter fields in a configurable column layout
- [ ] Users can switch between Kanban and table view without losing state
- [ ] Table handles 1000+ matters without performance degradation
- [ ] Real-time updates work consistently in both views
- [ ] Column preferences persist across sessions
- [ ] Responsive design works on tablet devices
- [ ] Basic accessibility standards are met (keyboard navigation)

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create base table component with column configuration
  - [ ] Implement table header with sortable columns
  - [ ] Add column resize and reorder functionality
  - [ ] Create column visibility toggles
  - [ ] Implement sticky header for scrolling

- [ ] Implement data virtualization for performance
  - [ ] Integrate virtual scrolling library (tanstack-virtual)
  - [ ] Handle dynamic row heights
  - [ ] Optimize rendering for visible rows only
  - [ ] Implement smooth scrolling with buffer rows

- [ ] Integrate with existing Kanban store
  - [ ] Use same matter store instance
  - [ ] Share filter and search state
  - [ ] Synchronize optimistic updates
  - [ ] Handle real-time sync events

- [ ] Create view switcher component
  - [ ] Add toggle between Kanban and table views
  - [ ] Preserve scroll position and selection
  - [ ] Animate view transitions
  - [ ] Save view preference to localStorage

- [ ] Add table-specific features
  - [ ] Density settings (compact/comfortable/spacious)
  - [ ] Basic column filters
  - [ ] Quick search within table

- [ ] Optimize performance
  - [ ] Implement memo for expensive computations
  - [ ] Optimize re-renders with Vue's shallowRef
  - [ ] Profile and fix performance bottlenecks

- [ ] Handle edge cases
  - [ ] Empty state with call-to-action
  - [ ] Loading states during data fetch
  - [ ] Error states with retry options
  - [ ] Offline mode indication

- [ ] Add basic testing
  - [ ] Unit tests for table components
  - [ ] Integration tests with store
  - [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Technical Guidance

### State Synchronization Strategy
- Both views should consume the same Pinia store instance (`useKanbanStore`)
- Use computed properties from the store for reactive data
- Ensure optimistic updates are reflected immediately in both views
- Handle store subscriptions for external updates

### Component Architecture
- Create a new `MatterTableView.vue` component
- Use composition API with proper separation of concerns
- Implement as a lazy-loaded component for code splitting
- Follow existing patterns from Kanban components

### Performance Considerations
- Use `shallowRef` for large arrays to prevent deep reactivity
- Implement virtual scrolling for rows beyond viewport
- Use CSS transforms for smoother animations

### Data Flow
- Table view → User interaction → Store action → Optimistic update → API call → Store update → View update
- Ensure all mutations go through the store for consistency
- Use store's existing error handling and rollback mechanisms

### Styling and Theming
- Leverage existing shadcn-vue components where applicable
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming
- Ensure dark mode compatibility
- Follow existing spacing and typography patterns
