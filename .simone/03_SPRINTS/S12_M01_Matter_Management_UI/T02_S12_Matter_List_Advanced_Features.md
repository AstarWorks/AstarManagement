# Task: Matter List Advanced Features Implementation

## Description
Extend the basic matter list data grid with advanced features including filtering, bulk operations, export functionality, and performance optimizations. This task builds upon the foundation established in T01_S12 to create a comprehensive matter management interface that supports complex workflows and large-scale operations.

## Goal / Objectives
Enhance the matter list component with powerful features for efficient case management:
- Implement advanced filtering system with persistent state
- Add bulk selection and operations functionality
- Enable data export in multiple formats
- Optimize performance with virtualization for large datasets
- Provide inline editing for quick updates
- Ensure all features maintain accessibility standards

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Advanced filters work correctly for all data types (text, date, status, tags)
- [ ] Filter state persists across page reloads using URL parameters
- [ ] Bulk selection allows selecting all/none/individual items
- [ ] Bulk operations (delete, status update) work with confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Export functionality generates CSV and Excel files with filtered data
- [ ] Virtual scrolling activates automatically for 100+ rows
- [ ] Inline editing works for allowed fields with validation
- [ ] Column resize and reorder functionality works smoothly
- [ ] Performance remains optimal with 10,000+ records
- [ ] All features maintain keyboard accessibility

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create advanced filter components for different data types
- [ ] Implement filter state persistence with URL synchronization
- [ ] Build row selection system with checkbox controls
- [ ] Add bulk action toolbar with action handlers
- [ ] Implement inline cell editing with validation
- [ ] Add column resize handles and drag-to-reorder
- [ ] Create export service for CSV and Excel generation
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- [ ] Add filter presets and saved views functionality
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with proper memoization
- [ ] Write integration tests for complex interactions
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation with examples

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Filter System Architecture
- Create composable filter components for reusability
- Implement filter state management in Pinia store
- Use URL query parameters for shareable filter states
- Add debouncing for text input filters

### Filter Components
```typescript
interface FilterConfig {
  field: string
  type: 'text' | 'select' | 'date' | 'daterange' | 'tags'
  label: string
  options?: FilterOption[]
  placeholder?: string
}

// Text filter with search
// Select filter with multi-select
// Date range picker
// Tag filter with autocomplete
```

### Bulk Operations Design
- Row selection with shift+click for range selection
- Select all with indeterminate state for partial selection
- Bulk action toolbar appears on selection
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Progress indication for long-running operations

### Export Implementation
- Client-side export for small datasets (<1000 rows)
- Server-side export for large datasets
- Support CSV and Excel (XLSX) formats
- Include only visible columns in export
- Apply current filters and sorting to export

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtual scrolling with vue-virtual-scroller
- Memoize expensive filter/sort operations
- Implement request debouncing and cancellation
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations
- Lazy load advanced features (filters, exports)

### Inline Editing
- Double-click or Enter key to activate edit mode
- Escape key to cancel, Enter to save
- Validation before saving changes
- Optimistic updates with rollback on error
- Visual indicators for edited cells

### Persistence Strategy
- Save filter state to URL for sharing
- Store user preferences in localStorage
- Remember column order and widths
- Sync state across browser tabs
- Export/import saved views

### Accessibility Enhancements
- Announce filter changes to screen readers
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Focus management during bulk operations
- Clear labeling for all controls
- High contrast mode support
