# Task: Implement Advanced Matter Form Features

## Description
Build advanced form functionality including auto-save capabilities, multi-step form workflows, and sophisticated assignment UI for lawyers and staff. This task extends the basic forms with enhanced user experience features that prevent data loss and streamline complex matter creation workflows.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement auto-save functionality to prevent data loss
- Build intuitive lawyer/staff assignment interface with search
- Support multi-step form workflow for complex matter creation
- Provide form state persistence and draft management
- Ensure smooth user experience with proper state management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Auto-save triggers after 5 seconds of inactivity and shows save status
- [x] Lawyer assignment UI supports search and multi-select functionality
- [x] Form preserves unsaved changes when navigating away (with confirmation)
- [x] Multi-step form shows progress and allows navigation between steps
- [x] Draft state is maintained separately from saved data
- [x] Conflict resolution handles simultaneous edits gracefully
- [x] Assignment fields support type-ahead search with debouncing
- [x] Form state persists across browser sessions

## Subtasks
- [x] Build `LawyerAssignmentField.vue` with search and multi-select
- [x] Add auto-save composable integration using `useAutoSave`
- [x] Create `MatterFormSteps.vue` for multi-step creation workflow
- [x] Implement `StepProgress.vue` component for visual progress
- [x] Add form state persistence using `useFormPersistence`
- [x] Create draft management system with conflict detection
- [x] Implement navigation guards for unsaved changes
- [x] Add save status indicators (saving/saved/error)
- [x] Write unit tests for advanced form features
- [x] Create Storybook stories for multi-step workflow
- [x] Add E2E tests for auto-save and persistence

## Technical Guidance

### Auto-Save Implementation
- Debounce saves to prevent excessive API calls
- Show save status indicator (saving/saved/error)
- Queue saves when offline and sync when connection restored
- Implement conflict detection for simultaneous edits

### Assignment Field Features
- Type-ahead search with minimum 2 characters
- Debounced API calls for search results
- Multi-select with chip display
- Role-based filtering (lawyers vs staff)
- Recent selections for quick access

### Multi-Step Form Architecture
```
components/forms/matter/
├── MatterFormSteps.vue         # Multi-step wrapper
├── steps/
│   ├── BasicInfoStep.vue       # Step 1: Basic matter info
│   ├── ClientDetailsStep.vue   # Step 2: Client selection
│   ├── AssignmentStep.vue      # Step 3: Lawyer/staff assignment
│   └── ReviewStep.vue          # Step 4: Review and submit
├── StepProgress.vue            # Progress indicator
└── StepNavigation.vue          # Next/Previous buttons
```

### State Management
- Use Pinia store for matter data persistence
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Handle conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Maintain form draft state separately from saved data

### Persistence Strategy
- Save drafts to localStorage with encryption
- Sync drafts with server periodically
- Clear drafts after successful submission
- Handle storage quota exceeded scenarios

## Implementation Notes
- Consider performance with large lawyer/client lists
- Implement proper loading states for async operations
- Add analytics tracking for form completion rates
- Ensure auto-save doesn't interfere with user typing
- Provide clear feedback for all user actions
- Handle edge cases like browser crashes gracefully
