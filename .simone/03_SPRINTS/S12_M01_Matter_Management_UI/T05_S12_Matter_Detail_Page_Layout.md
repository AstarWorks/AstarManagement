# Task: Matter Detail Page Layout

## Description
Design and implement the layout structure for the matter detail page with a tabbed interface for organizing different aspects of case information. This task focuses on creating a responsive layout that accommodates tabs for overview, documents, communications, financial tracking, and audit logs. The layout should integrate with the existing app layout system and support deep linking to specific tabs via URL parameters.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a structured matter detail page layout with sidebar navigation and tabbed content area
- Implement responsive design that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- Enable deep linking to specific tabs through Vue Router integration
- Establish a reusable pattern for detail pages with multiple content sections
- Ensure smooth navigation between tabs with proper state management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Matter detail page layout renders within the app layout container
- [x] Tab navigation is accessible and keyboard-navigable
- [x] URL updates when switching tabs (e.g., /matters/[id]?tab=documents)
- [x] Layout adapts responsively for mobile with appropriate tab display
- [x] Sidebar shows matter metadata and quick actions
- [x] Tab content area scrolls independently of header and navigation
- [x] Loading states are properly displayed for async tab content
- [x] Layout maintains consistency with existing design patterns

## Subtasks
- [x] Create matter detail page route structure (/matters/[id])
- [x] Design layout grid with sidebar and main content areas
- [x] Implement tab navigation component or integrate shadcn-vue tabs
- [x] Configure Vue Router for tab query parameter handling
- [x] Create sidebar component for matter metadata display
- [x] Set up tab content containers with proper scrolling behavior
- [x] Implement responsive breakpoints for mobile tab display
- [x] Add loading and error state handling for tab content
- [x] Create transition animations between tabs
- [x] Test deep linking functionality across all tabs
- [x] Ensure accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- [x] Document layout patterns for future detail pages

### Code Review Required Enhancements (Critical Failures)
- [x] Implement advanced state management pattern with Pinia stores for tab-specific state preservation
- [x] Add sub-tab view toggles for Tasks tab (Kanban/Table views)
- [x] Add sub-tab view toggles for Schedule tab (List/Calendar views)
- [x] Implement KeepAlive for tab content state preservation
- [x] Add prefetching for adjacent matter data
- [x] Implement keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1-9) for tab navigation
- [x] Add Previous/Next matter navigation with preloading
- [x] Enhance URL patterns to support sub-view deep linking (?tab=tasks&view=kanban)

## Output Log
*(This section is populated as work progresses on the task)*

[2025-07-02 14:39] Started task T05_S12 Matter Detail Page Layout
[2025-07-02 14:42] Created dynamic route page /pages/matters/[id].vue with complete layout structure
[2025-07-02 14:48] Implemented shadcn-vue tabs components (Tabs, TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent)
[2025-07-02 14:52] Created MatterSidebar.vue with comprehensive matter metadata display
[2025-07-02 14:55] Created 8 tab placeholder components (Overview, Tasks, Schedule, Communications, Documents, FAX, Billing, Notes)
[2025-07-02 15:00] Implemented responsive layout with mobile sidebar toggle and grid system
[2025-07-02 15:02] Added URL-based tab switching with Vue Router query parameter handling
[2025-07-02 15:05] Integrated loading states, error handling, and Suspense for async tab content
[2025-07-02 15:08] Added role-based tab access control and accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
[2025-07-02 15:10] Completed all 12 subtasks - Matter Detail Page Layout implementation finished

[2025-07-02 15:15]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Implementation does not meet advanced state management requirements specified in R05
**Scope:** T05_S12 Matter Detail Page Layout - comprehensive review of layout implementation, tab system, state management, and compliance with R05 Matter Detail Board specification
**Findings:** Critical deviations found with severity scores:
- Advanced State Management Pattern missing (Severity: 9/10) - Core task objective not implemented
- Sub-tab view toggles missing for Tasks (Kanban/Table) and Schedule (List/Calendar) (Severity: 8/10)
- KeepAlive and prefetching not implemented (Severity: 7/10) - State loss on tab switching
- Keyboard shortcuts missing (Ctrl+1-9) (Severity: 6/10)
- Previous/Next matter navigation missing (Severity: 5/10)
- URL patterns for sub-views incomplete (Severity: 4/10)
**Summary:** While layout structure and basic tab functionality are well-implemented with good responsive design and accessibility, the implementation fails to deliver the core "Advanced State Management Pattern" required by the task. Critical features like view toggles, state preservation, and sophisticated state management are completely missing.
**Recommendation:** REJECT - Implement advanced state management with Pinia stores, add view toggles for Tasks/Schedule tabs, implement KeepAlive for state preservation, add keyboard shortcuts, and enhance URL routing for sub-views before proceeding.

[2025-07-02 15:45]: Advanced State Management Implementation - PROGRESS
**Phase 1 Completed:** Core advanced state management pattern implemented with comprehensive Pinia store
- ✅ Created matterDetail.ts store with sophisticated state management patterns
- ✅ Implemented tab-specific state preservation using Map<string, TabState>
- ✅ Added sub-tab view management for Tasks (kanban/table) and Schedule (list/calendar)
- ✅ Integrated store with main matter detail page for reactive state management
- ✅ Added URL synchronization for sub-view deep linking
- ✅ Implemented auto-save functionality with localStorage persistence
- ✅ Added keyboard shortcut handling infrastructure
- ✅ Created comprehensive sub-tab view toggles with ToggleGroup components
- ✅ Built working Kanban/Table views for Tasks tab with realistic content
- ✅ Built working List/Calendar views for Schedule tab with realistic content

[2025-07-02 16:00]: Advanced Features Implementation - COMPLETED
**Phase 2 Completed:** All critical enhancement requirements successfully implemented
- ✅ KeepAlive implementation: Wrapped all tab contents with KeepAlive for state preservation
- ✅ Prefetching system: Full prefetching infrastructure in store with adjacent matter preloading
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+1-9 for tab navigation, Ctrl+←/→ for matter navigation
- ✅ Previous/Next navigation: Added navigation buttons with preloading functionality
- ✅ Enhanced URL patterns: Full support for sub-view deep linking (?tab=tasks&view=kanban)
- ✅ Store integration: Complete reactive integration between main page and Pinia store
- ✅ Performance optimization: Memory management with cleanup on component unmount
- ✅ Accessibility compliance: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support
