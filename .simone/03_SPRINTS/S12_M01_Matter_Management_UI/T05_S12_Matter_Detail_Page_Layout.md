# Task: Matter Detail Page Layout

## Description
Design and implement the layout structure for the matter detail page with a tabbed interface for organizing different aspects of case information. This task focuses on creating a responsive layout that accommodates tabs for overview, documents, communications, financial tracking, and audit logs. The layout should integrate with the existing app layout system and support deep linking to specific tabs via URL parameters.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create a structured matter detail page layout with sidebar navigation and tabbed content area
- Implement responsive design that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- Enable deep linking to specific tabs through Vue Router integration
- Establish a reusable pattern for detail pages with multiple content sections
- Ensure smooth navigation between tabs with proper state management

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Matter detail page layout renders within the app layout container
- [ ] Tab navigation is accessible and keyboard-navigable
- [ ] URL updates when switching tabs (e.g., /matters/[id]?tab=documents)
- [ ] Layout adapts responsively for mobile with appropriate tab display
- [ ] Sidebar shows matter metadata and quick actions
- [ ] Tab content area scrolls independently of header and navigation
- [ ] Loading states are properly displayed for async tab content
- [ ] Layout maintains consistency with existing design patterns

## Subtasks

- [ ] Design layout grid with sidebar and main content areas
- [ ] Implement tab navigation component or integrate shadcn-vue tabs
- [ ] Configure Vue Router for tab query parameter handling
- [ ] Create sidebar component for matter metadata display
- [ ] Set up tab content containers with proper scrolling behavior
- [ ] Implement responsive breakpoints for mobile tab display
- [ ] Add loading and error state handling for tab content
- [ ] Create transition animations between tabs
- [ ] Test deep linking functionality across all tabs
