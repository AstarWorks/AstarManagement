# Task: Filter Advanced Features

## Description
Implement advanced filter features including preset management, enhanced search capabilities with type-ahead suggestions, mobile optimization with a full-screen drawer, and undo/redo functionality. This task builds upon the core filter components to provide power-user features and an exceptional mobile experience.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement filter preset functionality with save/load capabilities
- Create advanced search modes with type-ahead suggestions
- Provide seamless mobile experience with optimized UI patterns
- Add undo/redo functionality for filter changes
- Enable filter export/import for sharing configurations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Filter presets can be saved, loaded, renamed, and deleted
- [ ] Mobile UI provides full-screen drawer with optimized touch controls
- [ ] Search input supports fuzzy/exact/field search modes with visual indicators
- [ ] Type-ahead suggestions work for case numbers, client names, and lawyer names
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality available for filter changes
- [ ] Filter configurations can be exported and imported
- [ ] Search history is maintained and accessible
- [ ] Mobile interface includes swipe gestures and larger tap targets
- [ ] Smooth animations and transitions throughout
- [ ] Preset management UI is intuitive and accessible

## Subtasks
### Preset Management
- [ ] Create filter preset management UI (save, load, delete presets)
- [ ] Implement preset storage in localStorage with versioning
- [ ] Add preset import/export functionality for sharing
- [ ] Create default system presets (e.g., "My Active Cases", "Urgent Matters")
- [ ] Add preset quick-access toolbar

### Mobile Optimization
- [ ] Create full-screen mobile filter drawer component
- [ ] Implement touch-optimized controls (larger tap targets, swipe gestures)
- [ ] Add filter summary badge for collapsed mobile view
- [ ] Ensure smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Optimize for one-handed mobile operation

### Search Enhancement
- [ ] Extend useAdvancedSearch composable for all searchable fields
- [ ] Implement type-ahead suggestions for case numbers and names
- [ ] Add search syntax help tooltip
- [ ] Create search history functionality
- [ ] Implement search mode toggle (fuzzy/exact/field-based)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Create filter history tracking for undo/redo
- [ ] Implement filter change notifications
- [ ] Add filter performance metrics display
- [ ] Create filter templates for common workflows
- [ ] Add batch filter operations

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write E2E tests for preset management workflows
- [ ] Create Storybook stories for mobile filter interface
- [ ] Test undo/redo functionality edge cases
- [ ] Document advanced search syntax and features
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for complex filters

## Technical Guidance
- Create a dedicated FilterPresets composable for preset management
- Mobile drawer should reuse existing Sheet component patterns
- Implement command pattern for undo/redo functionality
- Use Vue's Teleport for mobile drawer rendering
- Leverage browser's localStorage API with proper error handling
- Consider using IndexedDB for larger preset storage if needed
- Implement virtual scrolling for type-ahead suggestions

## Implementation Notes
- Preset schema should include: id, name, filters, createdAt, lastUsed, isSystem
- Mobile drawer should cover entire viewport with proper z-index management
- Type-ahead should use a debounced search with minimum 2 characters
- Undo/redo stack should have a reasonable limit (e.g., 20 actions)
- Search modes should be clearly indicated with icons/labels
- Consider implementing keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Mobile swipe gestures should feel native and responsive
- Export format should be JSON with schema version for compatibility
