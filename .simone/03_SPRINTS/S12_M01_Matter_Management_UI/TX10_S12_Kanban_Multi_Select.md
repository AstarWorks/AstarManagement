# Task: Kanban Multi-Select and Bulk Operations

## Description
Implement multi-select functionality and bulk operations for the Kanban board to enable users to efficiently manage multiple matters simultaneously. This task focuses on adding selection mechanisms, bulk action menus, and the underlying state management while maintaining performance and accessibility standards. The implementation should seamlessly integrate with the existing drag-drop infrastructure and real-time synchronization features.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement multi-select functionality with keyboard and mouse interactions
- Create bulk operations menu for selected matters (move, assign, delete, export)
- Add visual indicators and feedback for selected items
- Implement undo/redo functionality for bulk operations
- Ensure mobile-friendly touch gestures for multi-select
- Maintain accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Multi-select mode allows selecting multiple matters with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd+Click, Shift+Click)
- [x] Range selection works with Shift+Click between matters
- [x] Bulk operations menu appears when multiple matters are selected
- [x] Selected matters can be bulk moved between columns
- [x] Visual indicators clearly show selected/unselected states
- [x] Selection persists during scrolling and filtering
- [x] Touch gestures support multi-select on mobile devices
- [x] Undo/redo functionality available for bulk operations
- [x] Real-time sync updates selection state across users
- [x] Keyboard navigation (arrow keys + space) for selection

## Technical Guidance

### Architecture Considerations
- Extend existing KanbanBoard.vue component with selection logic
- Create new useMultiSelect composable for selection state management
- Leverage useKanbanDragDropEnhanced for bulk drag operations
- Use Pinia store for global selection state
- Implement command pattern for undo/redo functionality

### State Management Structure
```typescript
interface SelectionState {
  selectedMatterIds: Set<string>
  lastSelectedId: string | null
  selectionMode: 'single' | 'range' | 'multiple'
  bulkOperationInProgress: boolean
}
```

### Integration Points
- Extend useKanbanDragDropMutations for bulk operations
- Integrate with existing permission checking system
- Maintain compatibility with current filter/search features
- Preserve real-time sync for selection state
- Enhance existing keyboard navigation patterns

## Implementation Notes
- Review KanbanBoardEnhanced.vue for existing patterns
- Study useKanbanDragDropEnhanced.ts for state management
- Reference existing bulk operations in Export functionality
- Consider performance impact of selection rendering
- Ensure selection state doesn't interfere with drag-drop
- Mobile touch handling should not conflict with scrolling

## Subtasks
- [x] Research and analyze current Kanban implementation
- [x] Design multi-select state management architecture
- [x] Implement selection tracking composable
  - [x] Create useMultiSelect composable
  - [x] Handle Ctrl/Cmd+Click for individual selection
  - [x] Implement Shift+Click for range selection
  - [x] Add Select All/Deselect All functionality
- [x] Update MatterCard component for selection
  - [x] Add selection checkbox UI element
  - [x] Implement selection visual indicators
  - [x] Handle click events for selection
  - [x] Ensure proper ARIA attributes
- [x] Create bulk operations menu
  - [x] Design floating action menu component
  - [x] Implement bulk move operation
  - [x] Add bulk assign functionality
  - [x] Create bulk delete with confirmation
  - [x] Add bulk export option
- [x] Implement bulk drag-drop
  - [x] Modify drag preview for multiple cards
  - [x] Update drop logic for multiple matters
  - [x] Add visual feedback for bulk operations
  - [x] Handle invalid drop scenarios
- [x] Add undo/redo functionality
  - [x] Implement command pattern for operations
  - [x] Create undo/redo stack management
  - [x] Add keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z/Y)
  - [x] Show toast notifications for undo/redo
- [x] Mobile touch gesture support
  - [x] Implement long-press for selection mode
  - [x] Add touch-friendly selection UI
  - [x] Create mobile bulk action menu
  - [x] Test gesture conflicts with scrolling
- [ ] Testing and integration
  - [ ] Write unit tests for useMultiSelect
  - [ ] Add E2E tests for bulk operations
  - [ ] Test real-time sync of selection
  - [ ] Verify accessibility compliance
  - [ ] Performance test with 100+ selections
