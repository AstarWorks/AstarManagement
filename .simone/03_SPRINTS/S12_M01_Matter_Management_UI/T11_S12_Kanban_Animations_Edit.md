# Task: Kanban Animations and Quick Edit

## Description
Enhance the Kanban board with smooth animations and inline quick edit capabilities to improve user experience and workflow efficiency. This task focuses on implementing fluid motion design for drag-drop operations, state transitions, and adding inline editing functionality that allows rapid matter updates without modal dialogs. All animations should be performant and respect accessibility preferences.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement smooth, performant animations for all board interactions
- Add inline quick edit mode for rapid matter updates
- Create visual feedback for user actions and state changes
- Optimize animation performance for 60fps on all devices
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion accessibility settings
- Ensure animations enhance rather than hinder usability

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Drag-drop animations follow Material Design motion principles
- [ ] All animations maintain < 16ms frame time (60fps)
- [ ] Quick edit mode activates on double-click or F2 key
- [ ] Inline editing supports all matter fields
- [ ] Auto-save triggers after 2 seconds of inactivity
- [ ] Validation feedback appears inline during editing
- [ ] Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion setting
- [ ] Card expand/collapse animations are smooth
- [ ] Loading states have skeleton animations
- [ ] Mobile animations are optimized for performance

## Technical Guidance

### Animation Architecture
- Use Vue 3 Transition and TransitionGroup components
- Implement CSS-based animations for performance
- Leverage requestAnimationFrame for JavaScript animations
- Use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- Implement FLIP technique for layout animations

### Quick Edit Implementation
- Extend MatterCard component with edit mode
- Create inline form components for each field type
- Use v-model for two-way binding in edit mode
- Implement debounced auto-save mechanism
- Add optimistic updates with rollback on error

### Performance Considerations
```css
/* Use GPU-accelerated properties */
.card-transition {
  will-change: transform;
  transform: translateZ(0); /* Force GPU layer */
  transition: transform 200ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
}
```

## Implementation Notes
- Study existing transition patterns in KanbanColumn.vue
- Reference Vue 3 Transition documentation for best practices
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab for profiling
- Consider using Web Animations API for complex sequences
- Implement progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Test animations on low-end devices for performance

- [ ] Accessibility enhancements
  - [ ] Detect prefers-reduced-motion
  - [ ] Create reduced motion variants
  - [ ] Ensure animations don't interfere with screen readers
  - [ ] Add animation pause controls
  - [ ] Test with accessibility tools
- [ ] Testing and polish
  - [ ] Create visual regression tests
  - [ ] Test on various devices/browsers
  - [ ] Add Storybook stories for animations
  - [ ] Document animation guidelines
  - [ ] Performance benchmark suite
