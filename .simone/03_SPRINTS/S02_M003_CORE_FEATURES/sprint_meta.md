# S02_M003: Core Expense Features

## Sprint Goal
Implement the essential expense CRUD operations and forms, providing users with the core functionality to create, view, edit, and delete expenses through an intuitive interface.

## Key Deliverables
- Expense list view with pagination and filtering
- Expense creation form with validation
- Expense detail view with complete information display
- Expense edit functionality with optimistic updates
- Delete confirmation and soft delete implementation
- Real-time form validation with helpful error messages
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Empty states with helpful guidance
- Basic mock data service for development

## Definition of Done
- [x] Expense list displays with proper pagination
- [x] Filtering works for date range, category, and amount
- [x] Create expense form validates all fields properly
- [x] Edit functionality updates expenses correctly
- [x] Delete operation includes confirmation dialog
- [x] All forms show real-time validation feedback
- [x] Loading states appear during data operations
- [x] Error states handle API failures gracefully
- [x] Mobile responsive design verified
- [x] Accessibility scan passes
- [x] Unit tests cover critical paths
- [x] TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Dependencies
- Completed S01_M003 foundation (types, routing, i18n)
- Mock data services for API simulation
- Design system components from M001
- Form validation patterns established

## Tasks
- T01_S02_M003: Mock Data Service for Expense Management (4 hours) - COMPLETED
- T02_S02_M003: Expense List View with Filtering and Pagination (6 hours) - COMPLETED
- T03_S02_M003: Create Expense Form with Validation (8 hours) - COMPLETED
- T04_S02_M003: Expense Detail View (8 hours) - COMPLETED
- T05_S02_M003: Edit Expense Functionality (8 hours) - COMPLETED
- T06_S02_M003: Delete Functionality with Confirmation (4 hours) - COMPLETED
- T07_S02_M003: Loading, Error, and Empty States (4 hours) - COMPLETED

**Total Estimated Hours**: 42 hours (5-6 days)

## Technical Considerations
- Use Pinia for state management
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
- Virtual scrolling for large expense lists
- Debounced search and filter inputs
- Form state persistence during navigation
- Proper TypeScript types throughout
- **Use TanStackTable (TanStack Table v8) for all table implementations**
  - Replace any existing custom table implementations with TanStackTable
  - Leverage TanStackTable's built-in features: sorting, filtering, pagination, column resizing
  - Implement server-side pagination and filtering with TanStackTable adapters
- **Use shadcn-vue components for UI consistency**
  - Integrate shadcn-vue table components with TanStackTable
  - Use shadcn-vue form components for all forms
  - Ensure consistent styling across all UI elements

## Notes
This sprint delivers the core user-facing functionality that legal professionals will use daily. Focus on intuitive design, helpful validation messages, and smooth interactions. The mock data service will simulate backend responses until M002 integration.
