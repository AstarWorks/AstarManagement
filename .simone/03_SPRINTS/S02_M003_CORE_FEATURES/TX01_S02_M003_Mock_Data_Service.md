# T01_S02_M003: Mock Data Service for Expense Management

## Description
Create a comprehensive mock data service that simulates backend API responses for expense management development. This service will generate realistic expense data, handle CRUD operations in memory, simulate API delays, and integrate seamlessly with the existing frontend architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create comprehensive mock data service for expense operations
- [ ] Generate realistic Japanese legal practice expense data
- [ ] Implement in-memory CRUD operations with state persistence
- [ ] Simulate API response delays and error conditions
- [ ] Integrate with existing MSW (Mock Service Worker) infrastructure
- [ ] Support all expense API endpoints from backend specifications
- [ ] Provide data seeding for consistent development experience
- [ ] Include category-specific mock data generation
- [ ] Support filtering, pagination, and search operations
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Technical Details

### 1. Mock Data Generation Service

**Location**: `frontend/app/services/mockExpenseDataService.ts`

**Core Features**:
```typescript
interface MockExpenseDataService {
  // Data generation
  generateExpense(overrides?: Partial<IExpense>): IExpense
  generateExpenseList(count: number, filters?: IExpenseFilter): IExpense[]
  generateExpenseStats(period: { startDate: string; endDate: string }): IExpenseStatsResponse
  
  // Data seeding
  seedDatabase(expenseCount?: number): Promise<void>
  resetDatabase(): Promise<void>
  
  // Category-specific generators
  generateTransportationExpense(): IExpense
  generateStampFeeExpense(): IExpense
  generateCopyFeeExpense(): IExpense
  generatePostageExpense(): IExpense
  generateOtherExpense(): IExpense
}
```

**Mock Data Categories** (Legal Practice Focus):
- Transportation (交通費): Train fares, taxi rides, parking fees
- Stamp fees (印紙代): Court document fees, contract stamps
- Copy fees (コピー代): Document copying, printing
- Postage (郵送料): Mail, courier services
- Other (その他): Miscellaneous legal practice expenses

### 2. Enhanced MSW Handlers

**Location**: `frontend/app/mocks/handlers/expense.ts` (enhancement)

**Current Implementation Analysis**:
- Basic CRUD endpoints exist but lack realistic data
- No filtering, search, or pagination support
- Missing bulk operations and statistics endpoints
- No error simulation capabilities

**Enhancement Requirements**:
```typescript
// Enhanced handlers with realistic data
export const enhancedExpenseHandlers = [
  // Existing endpoints with enhanced data
  http.get('/api/v1/expenses', enhancedGetExpenses),
  http.get('/api/v1/expenses/:id', enhancedGetExpense),
  http.post('/api/v1/expenses', enhancedCreateExpense),
  http.put('/api/v1/expenses/:id', enhancedUpdateExpense),
  http.delete('/api/v1/expenses/:id', enhancedDeleteExpense),
  
  // New endpoints
  http.get('/api/v1/expenses/summary', getExpenseSummary),
  http.get('/api/v1/expenses/stats', getExpenseStats),
  http.post('/api/v1/expenses/bulk-delete', bulkDeleteExpenses),
  http.get('/api/v1/expenses/categories', getExpenseCategories),
]
```

### 3. In-Memory Data Store

**Implementation Pattern**:
```typescript
class MockExpenseStore {
  private expenses: Map<string, IExpense> = new Map()
  private tags: Map<string, ITag> = new Map()
  private attachments: Map<string, IAttachment> = new Map()
  
  // CRUD operations with tenant isolation
  async createExpense(tenantId: string, data: ICreateExpenseRequest): Promise<IExpense>
  async updateExpense(tenantId: string, id: string, data: IUpdateExpenseRequest): Promise<IExpense>
  async deleteExpense(tenantId: string, id: string): Promise<void>
  async findExpense(tenantId: string, id: string): Promise<IExpense | null>
  
  // Query operations
  async findExpenses(tenantId: string, filter: IExpenseFilter): Promise<IExpenseList>
  async getExpenseStats(tenantId: string, params: IExpenseStatsParams): Promise<IExpenseStatsResponse>
  
  // Utility methods
  private calculateBalance(expenses: IExpense[]): number
  private filterExpenses(expenses: IExpense[], filter: IExpenseFilter): IExpense[]
  private sortExpenses(expenses: IExpense[], sortBy?: string, sortOrder?: string): IExpense[]
}
```

### 4. Realistic Data Patterns

**Legal Practice Scenarios**:
- Court appearances with transportation and document fees
- Client meetings with travel expenses
- Document preparation with copying and postage
- Court filing fees and stamp duties
- Office supplies and equipment

**Data Realism Features**:
- Japanese business addresses and station names
- Realistic expense amounts based on legal practice norms
- Proper date distributions (working days, court schedules)
- Case-specific expense clustering
- Seasonal variations in expense patterns

### 5. Error Simulation

**Error Scenarios**:
```typescript
interface ErrorSimulationConfig {
  networkFailureRate: number    // 0.05 = 5% failure rate
  serverErrorRate: number       // 0.02 = 2% server errors
  validationErrorRate: number   // 0.1 = 10% validation errors
  timeoutRate: number          // 0.03 = 3% timeout errors
}
```

**Configurable Error Types**:
- Network connectivity issues
- Server-side validation errors
- Timeout scenarios
- Conflict errors (optimistic locking)
- Authorization failures

### 6. Integration Points

**Existing Infrastructure Usage**:
- Leverage current MSW setup in `frontend/app/mocks/server.ts`
- Integrate with existing TypeScript interfaces from S01_M003
- Use established API patterns from `frontend/app/composables/useApi.ts`
- Follow existing Pinia store patterns for state management

**Composables Integration**:
```typescript
// Extend existing useApi composable for development
export const useMockExpenseApi = () => {
  const { get, post, put, delete: del } = useApi()
  
  // Mock-aware API calls with development logging
  const createExpense = async (data: ICreateExpenseRequest) => {
    console.log('[Mock] Creating expense:', data)
    return post<IExpenseResponse>('/api/v1/expenses', data)
  }
  
  // Other mock-aware methods...
}
```

## Integration Guidelines

### 1. TypeScript Interface Usage
- Use all interfaces from `frontend/app/types/expense/` directory
- Maintain strict type safety throughout mock implementations
- Leverage discriminated unions from existing auth patterns
- Follow established Result<T, E> pattern for error handling

### 2. State Management with Pinia
```typescript
// Mock store for development data persistence
export const useMockExpenseStore = defineStore('mockExpense', () => {
  const expenses = ref<IExpense[]>([])
  const isLoading = ref(false)
  const error = ref<IApiError | null>(null)
  
  // Actions that mirror real store but use mock service
  const fetchExpenses = async (filter: IExpenseFilter) => {
    // Implementation using mock service
  }
  
  return {
    expenses: readonly(expenses),
    isLoading: readonly(isLoading),
    error: readonly(error),
    fetchExpenses,
    // Other actions...
  }
})
```

### 3. API Response Format Compliance
- Follow exact format from `docs/40-specs/04-feature-specs/expense-input/expense-api-endpoints.md`
- Implement proper pagination metadata
- Include audit fields (createdAt, updatedAt, version)
- Maintain tenant isolation in all responses

### 4. Development Experience Features
- Console logging for debugging mock operations
- Visual indicators in UI for mock mode
- Easy data reset functionality
- Configurable data generation parameters
- Development-only endpoints for testing edge cases
