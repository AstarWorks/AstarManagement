# Task: Loading States and Skeleton Screens

## Description
Implement loading indicators and skeleton screens throughout the application for better user experience. This provides visual feedback during data fetching and prevents layout shifts, creating a smooth and professional feel.

## Goal / Objectives
- Create reusable skeleton components
- Implement loading states for all async operations
- Add progressive loading for better perceived performance
- Prevent layout shifts during loading
- Create smooth transitions between states

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All data fetching shows loading indicators
- [x] Skeleton screens match actual content layout
- [x] No layout shifts when content loads
- [x] Loading states are accessible (ARIA)
- [x] Smooth fade transitions between states
- [x] Mobile loading states are optimized
- [x] Critical content loads first
- [x] Loading states respect theme (light/dark)

## Subtasks
- [x] Create skeleton components for cards
- [x] Create skeleton for board layout
- [x] Add loading states to all buttons
- [x] Implement progressive data loading
- [x] Add shimmer animation effects
- [x] Create loading state for forms
- [x] Add suspense boundaries
- [x] Test perceived performance

## Technical Guidance

### Key Interfaces and Integration Points
- **Skeleton Components**: Create `/frontend/src/components/ui/skeleton/`
- **Board Loading**: Update `/frontend/src/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx`
- **Card Loading**: Create skeleton version of MatterCard
- **Suspense**: Use React Suspense where appropriate

### Specific Imports and Module References
```typescript
// New skeleton components
/frontend/src/components/ui/skeleton/CardSkeleton.tsx
/frontend/src/components/ui/skeleton/BoardSkeleton.tsx
/frontend/src/components/ui/skeleton/FormSkeleton.tsx

// Update existing
/frontend/src/components/kanban/KanbanBoard.tsx
/frontend/src/stores/kanban-store.ts (loading states)

// Libraries
react-loading-skeleton (optional)
```

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- Use Tailwind CSS animations
- Follow existing color schemes
- Match exact component dimensions
- Use existing loading props

### Database Models to Work With
```typescript
// Loading states in store
interface LoadingState {
  isLoading: boolean;
  isInitialLoad: boolean;
  loadingOperation?: 'fetch' | 'create' | 'update' | 'delete';
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach
1. Create base skeleton components
2. Add shimmer animation with Tailwind
3. Replace loading spinners with skeletons
4. Implement progressive loading
5. Add loading states to buttons
6. Create form skeletons
7. Add React Suspense boundaries
8. Optimize for mobile

### Key Architectural Decisions to Respect
- Keep skeletons lightweight
- Match exact layouts
- Support theme switching
- Maintain accessibility

### Testing Approach
- Test with slow network throttling
- Verify no layout shifts
- Check accessibility
- Test theme compliance
- Measure perceived performance
- Test on mobile devices

### Performance Considerations
- Use CSS animations (GPU accelerated)
- Lazy load skeleton components
- Keep skeleton markup minimal
- Avoid JavaScript animations
