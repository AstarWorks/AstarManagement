# Sprint: Integration and Polish (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Connect frontend and backend components, implement advanced features, and polish the user experience with proper error handling and performance optimization.

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Frontend-backend API integration
- Advanced search functionality (matter name, client, case number)
- Audit history timeline view
- Status transition confirmations and validations
- Error handling and user notifications
- Loading states and skeleton screens
- Performance optimization (caching, pagination)
- Form components for creating/editing matters

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)

- [ ] Status transitions show confirmation dialogs
- [ ] All API errors handled gracefully with user feedback
- [ ] Loading states implemented throughout
- [ ] Page load time < 2 seconds with 100 matters
- [ ] Integration tests passing for critical user flows
- [ ] No console errors in production build
