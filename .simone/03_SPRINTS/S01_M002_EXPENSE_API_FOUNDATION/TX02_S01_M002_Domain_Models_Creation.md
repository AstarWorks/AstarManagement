# T02_S01_M002: Domain Models and DTOs Creation

## Description
Define the core domain models, entities, and data transfer objects (DTOs) for the expense management system. This includes creating the Expense, Tag, and Attachment domain models along with their corresponding request/response DTOs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create domain entities with proper annotations
- [ ] Define value objects for complex types (Money, ExpenseCategory)
- [ ] Create request DTOs with validation annotations
- [ ] Create response DTOs with proper serialization
- [ ] Implement domain model mappers
- [ ] Add audit fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)
- [ ] Include version field for optimistic locking
- [ ] Document all models with KDoc

## Technical Details

### Domain Models

#### Expense Entity
```kotlin
@Entity
@Table(name = "expenses")
data class Expense(
    @Id
    val id: UUID = UUID.randomUUID(),
    val tenantId: UUID,
    val date: LocalDate,
    val category: String,
    val description: String,
    val incomeAmount: BigDecimal = BigDecimal.ZERO,
    val expenseAmount: BigDecimal = BigDecimal.ZERO,
    var balance: BigDecimal = BigDecimal.ZERO,
    val caseId: UUID? = null,
    val memo: String? = null,
    @Embedded
    val auditInfo: AuditInfo = AuditInfo(),
    @Version
    val version: Int = 0
)
```

#### Tag Entity
```kotlin
@Entity
@Table(name = "tags")
data class Tag(
    @Id
    val id: UUID = UUID.randomUUID(),
    val tenantId: UUID,
    val name: String,
    val nameNormalized: String,
    val color: String,
    val scope: TagScope = TagScope.TENANT,
    val ownerId: UUID? = null,
    var usageCount: Int = 0,
    var lastUsedAt: Instant? = null,
    @Embedded
    val auditInfo: AuditInfo = AuditInfo()
)
```

### Request/Response DTOs

#### CreateExpenseRequest
```kotlin
data class CreateExpenseRequest(
    @field:NotNull
    @field:PastOrPresent
    val date: LocalDate,
    
    @field:NotBlank
    @field:Size(max = 50)
    val category: String,
    
    @field:NotBlank
    @field:Size(max = 500)
    val description: String,
    
    @field:DecimalMin("0.00")
    @field:Digits(integer = 10, fraction = 2)
    val incomeAmount: BigDecimal? = BigDecimal.ZERO,
    
    @field:DecimalMin("0.00")
    @field:Digits(integer = 10, fraction = 2)
    val expenseAmount: BigDecimal? = BigDecimal.ZERO,
    
    val caseId: UUID? = null,
    val memo: String? = null,
    val tagIds: List<UUID> = emptyList(),
    val attachmentIds: List<UUID> = emptyList()
)
```

## Subtasks
- [x] Create Expense domain model
- [x] Create Tag domain model
- [x] Create Attachment domain model
- [x] Create AuditInfo embeddable
- [x] Create request DTOs with validation
- [x] Create response DTOs
- [x] Implement model mappers
- [ ] Add unit tests for validation

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Validation annotations work correctly
- [ ] Mappers convert between domain and DTOs properly
- [ ] Audit fields populate automatically
- [ ] Version field increments on updates

## Notes
- Use BigDecimal for all monetary values
- Ensure proper null safety with Kotlin
- Follow existing naming conventions from the project
- Consider using @Embeddable for common fields

## Output Log
[2025-08-04 02:38]: Task started - Creating domain models and DTOs
[2025-08-04 02:40]: Created AuditInfo embeddable with soft delete support and audit tracking
[2025-08-04 02:41]: Created Expense domain model with validation, relationships, and business methods
[2025-08-04 02:42]: Created Tag domain model with scope support (TENANT/PERSONAL) and usage tracking
[2025-08-04 02:43]: Created ExpenseAttachment link entity with composite key
[2025-08-04 02:44]: Created Attachment domain model with status management and file metadata
[2025-08-04 02:45]: Created CreateExpenseRequest with comprehensive validation annotations
[2025-08-04 02:46]: Created UpdateExpenseRequest with partial update support and optimistic locking
[2025-08-04 02:46]: Created CreateTagRequest with hex color validation
[2025-08-04 02:47]: Created ExpenseResponse, TagResponse, and AttachmentResponse DTOs
[2025-08-04 02:48]: Created PagedResponse wrapper for pagination support
[2025-08-04 02:49]: Implemented ExpenseMapper, TagMapper, and AttachmentMapper for DTO conversions
[2025-08-04 02:50]: All domain models and DTOs created following clean architecture principles
[2025-08-04 02:48]: Code Review - FAIL
Result: **FAIL** - Multiple specification violations and missing required features
**Scope:** T02_S01_M002 - Domain Models and DTOs Creation
**Findings:** 
  - Tag system implementation not in specification - Severity 8/10
  - Validation rule mismatches (description 500 vs 200, memo 1000 vs 500) - Severity 9/10
  - Missing required endpoints (CSV import/export, reports, categories) - Severity 10/10
  - Response format doesn't match API contract (missing wrapper) - Severity 7/10
  - Attachment model over-engineered compared to spec - Severity 6/10
  - Pagination field naming convention mismatch - Severity 5/10
**Summary:** Implementation deviates significantly from specifications with added complexity and missing required features
**Recommendation:** Align validation rules, simplify tag/attachment systems, implement missing endpoints
[2025-08-04 02:52]: Fixed validation rules to match specification:
  - Updated description max length from 500 to 200 characters
  - Updated memo max length from 1000 to 500 characters
  - Added date validation to ensure within past 1 year
  - Applied fixes to both CreateExpenseRequest and UpdateExpenseRequest
  - Updated Expense entity column length for description
[2025-08-04 02:53]: Build successful after validation fixes
