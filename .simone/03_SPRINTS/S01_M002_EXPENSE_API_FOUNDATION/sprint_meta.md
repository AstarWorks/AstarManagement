# S01_M002: Expense API Foundation

## Sprint Goal
Establish the foundational API structure for the expense management system, including Spring Boot module setup, basic controller structure, and repository interfaces.

## Key Deliverables
- Spring Boot expense module structure with clean architecture
- Basic REST controllers for expense endpoints
- Repository interfaces following DDD patterns
- Initial database schema design (not implementation)
- Basic request/response DTOs
- API error handling framework
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation setup
- Basic unit test structure

## Definition of Done
- [x] Expense module created with proper package structure
- [x] Basic CRUD endpoints defined (not fully implemented)
- [x] Repository interfaces created
- [x] DTOs and domain models defined
- [x] Global exception handler configured
- [x] Swagger UI accessible at /swagger-ui
- [x] Unit test framework established
- [x] Code compiles without errors
- [x] Basic CI pipeline runs successfully

## Dependencies
- Spring Boot project structure from M001
- Database design documentation from docs/40-specs/expense-input/

## Tasks
- T01_S01_M002: Expense Module Setup (4 hours)
- T02_S01_M002: Domain Models and DTOs Creation (6 hours)
- T03_S01_M002: Repository Interfaces Definition (4 hours)
- T04_S01_M002: REST Controllers Implementation (6 hours)
- T05_S01_M002: Error Handling Framework (4 hours)
- T06_S01_M002: OpenAPI/Swagger Documentation Setup (3 hours)
- T07_S01_M002: Unit Test Framework Setup (3 hours)

**Total Estimated Hours**: 30 hours (5-6 days)

## Notes
This sprint focuses on structure and interfaces rather than full implementation. The goal is to establish a solid foundation following clean architecture principles that subsequent sprints can build upon.
