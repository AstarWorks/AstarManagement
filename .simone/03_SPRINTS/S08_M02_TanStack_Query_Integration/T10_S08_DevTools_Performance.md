# Task: DevTools Integration and Performance Optimization

## Description
Integrate TanStack Query DevTools and optimize performance to meet sub-200ms response targets. This task focuses on implementing comprehensive performance monitoring, optimizing query configurations for the legal case management domain, and ensuring the application meets the architectural performance requirements while providing visibility into data fetching patterns through development tools.

## Goal / Objectives
- Configure TanStack Query DevTools for development environment visibility
- Implement performance monitoring using Web Vitals and existing metrics
- Optimize query configurations to meet p95 < 200ms API response targets
- Set up bundle size monitoring and optimization strategies
- Integrate with existing performance composables and monitoring infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TanStack Query DevTools loads conditionally in development only
- [ ] Web Vitals monitoring is integrated with performance tracking
- [ ] Query performance metrics are collected and logged
- [ ] Bundle size impact of TanStack Query is optimized (< 15KB gzipped)
- [ ] Performance regression tests are passing
- [ ] Cache warming strategies are implemented for critical paths
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable under sustained usage
- [ ] DevTools provide clear visibility into query states and cache

## Subtasks
- [ ] Configure conditional loading of @tanstack/vue-query-devtools
- [ ] Integrate Web Vitals tracking with existing useMobilePerformance composable
- [ ] Implement query performance monitoring middleware
- [ ] Set up cache warming for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Configure optimal query defaults for legal domain (longer stale times)
- [ ] Implement bundle splitting for DevTools in development
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection for query operations
- [ ] Create performance dashboard component for monitoring
- [ ] Set up automated performance regression testing
- [ ] Document performance optimization strategies

## Technical Guidance

### Existing Performance Infrastructure
The codebase includes comprehensive performance monitoring in `src/composables/useMobilePerformance.ts`:
- FPS tracking and measurement utilities
- Memory usage monitoring
- Render time performance marks
- Virtual scrolling and lazy loading helpers
- GPU acceleration utilities
- Batch DOM update strategies

### Performance Targets (from Architecture)
- **API Response**: p95 < 200ms
- **PDF First Paint**: < 1 second
- **Search Results**: < 500ms
- **System Availability**: 99.9% (cloud)

### Web Vitals Integration
The project already includes `web-vitals` package (v5.0.3) which should be integrated with:
- Core Web Vitals monitoring (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Custom metrics for legal domain operations
- Performance budgets and alerting

### DevTools Configuration Patterns
Based on existing Nuxt configuration:
- Development-only plugins use `.client.ts` suffix
- Conditional loading based on `process.dev`
- Integration with existing Vue DevTools setup
- Proper tree-shaking for production builds

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Query Configuration**
   - Longer staleTime for legal case data (changes infrequently)
   - Selective prefetching for kanban columns
   - Background refetching during idle time
   - Query result compression strategies

2. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Dynamic import for DevTools
   - Separate chunk for query library
   - Tree-shake unused query features
   - Optimize for legal domain use cases

3. **Cache Strategies**
   - Persistent cache for offline support
   - Hierarchical cache invalidation
   - Optimistic updates for UI responsiveness
   - Background sync for data consistency

### Performance Testing Infrastructure
Existing performance tests in `src/test/performance/realtime-load.test.ts` demonstrate:
- Rapid update handling benchmarks
- Concurrent operation testing
- Memory usage validation
- Processing time assertions

### Metrics Collection Approach
1. **Query Metrics**
   - Query execution time
   - Cache hit/miss ratios
   - Network request frequency
   - Data payload sizes

2. **Application Metrics**
   - Component render times
   - Time to interactive (TTI)
   - Bundle size impact
   - Memory consumption patterns

3. **User Experience Metrics**
   - Perceived performance scores
   - Loading state durations
   - Error recovery times
   - Offline functionality metrics

## Implementation Notes

### DevTools Integration Strategy
1. **Conditional Loading**: Use dynamic imports with environment checks
2. **Development Experience**: Position DevTools for easy access without blocking UI
3. **Performance Impact**: Ensure DevTools don't affect metrics collection
4. **Feature Flags**: Allow DevTools toggle via environment variable

### Performance Monitoring Architecture
1. **Middleware Layer**: Intercept all queries for timing measurement
2. **Metrics Aggregation**: Collect and batch performance data
3. **Visualization**: Create dashboard showing query performance trends
4. **Alerting**: Set up thresholds for performance regression detection

### Optimization Techniques
1. **Query Deduplication**: Prevent redundant network requests
2. **Request Batching**: Combine multiple queries when possible
3. **Selective Hydration**: Only hydrate visible content on SSR
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Load critical data first, enhance later

### Bundle Size Considerations
1. **Code Splitting**: Separate TanStack Query into its own chunk
2. **Tree Shaking**: Import only used features
3. **Compression**: Enable gzip/brotli for query library
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load DevTools only when requested

### Integration Points
- Leverage existing `useMobilePerformance` composable
- Integrate with Nuxt's built-in performance features
- Maintain compatibility with SSR optimization
- Preserve existing error handling patterns
