## Description
Implement advanced TanStack Query features for matters including infinite scrolling, search functionality, filter state management, and SSR prefetch utilities

## Parent: S08_M02_TanStack_Query_Integration

## Technical Guidance

### API Endpoint Patterns
- GET `/api/matters` - Supports pagination, search, and filtering
- Query parameters: page, limit, search, status, priority, assignee
- Response includes pagination metadata and search suggestions

### SSR Considerations
- Server API routes include cache headers for optimization
- ETag support for conditional requests
- Stale-while-revalidate caching strategy
- Query parameter support for server-side filtering

### Existing Search/Filter Patterns
- SearchSuggestion interface for autocomplete
- FilterState interface for complex filtering
- ViewPreferences for user-specific settings
- Existing Pinia store patterns for filter synchronization

## Implementation Notes

### Advanced Query Features
- Infinite scrolling for large matter lists
- Real-time search with debouncing
- Complex filter state management
- SSR prefetching and hydration
- Query invalidation and subscription patterns
- Statistics and aggregation queries

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement query persistence for offline support
- Add proper caching strategies
- Support for conditional requests
- Optimistic UI updates for filters
