# Task: Background Sync Configuration

## Description
Configure background refetching and WebSocket integration for keeping data synchronized across sessions. This task focuses on implementing intelligent sync strategies that balance real-time updates with performance considerations, including tab visibility handling, network status detection, and automatic reconnection patterns.

## Goal / Objectives
- Implement intelligent background refetching based on tab visibility and user activity
- Configure WebSocket integration for real-time updates with fallback to polling
- Create network-aware sync strategies with exponential backoff
- Optimize performance for both active and background tabs
- Ensure data consistency across multiple browser tabs/windows

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Background refetching pauses when tab is not visible
- [ ] WebSocket connections automatically reconnect on network recovery
- [ ] Polling intervals adjust based on network conditions
- [ ] Query invalidation cascades properly for dependent data
- [ ] Stale data indicators display correctly during sync
- [ ] Performance metrics show no degradation from background sync
- [ ] Multiple tabs sync without conflicts or duplicate requests

## Technical Guidance

### WebSocket Infrastructure
The codebase already includes a comprehensive WebSocket composable at `src/composables/useWebSocketConnection.ts` with:
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Heartbeat mechanism for connection health
- Event-based message handling
- Connection state management

### Current Polling Implementation
The Kanban real-time updates use a polling mechanism configured in:
- `src/composables/useKanbanRealTime.ts` - 5-second polling interval
- `src/composables/useRealTimeUpdates.ts` - Generic polling composable
- `src/config/realtime.ts` - Central configuration for real-time settings

### Tab Visibility Handling
Consider using:
- `document.visibilityState` API for tab visibility detection
- VueUse's `usePageVisibility` composable for reactive visibility state
- Pause/resume strategies for background tabs
- Reduced polling frequency for hidden tabs

### Network Status Detection
Leverage existing infrastructure:
- `src/composables/useOfflineQueue.ts` - Comprehensive offline queue management
- VueUse's `useOnline` for network status
- Automatic queue processing on reconnection
- Priority-based message queuing

### Performance Considerations
- Implement request deduplication across tabs using BroadcastChannel API
- Use TanStack Query's `refetchInterval` with dynamic values
- Configure `staleTime` and `gcTime` based on data volatility
- Implement selective query invalidation to minimize refetch cascades

## Implementation Notes

### Sync Strategy Architecture
1. **Active Tab Strategy**
   - WebSocket connection for real-time updates
   - Immediate query invalidation on updates
   - Full polling frequency (5 seconds)
   - Prefetching for anticipated user actions

2. **Background Tab Strategy**
   - Disconnect WebSocket to save resources
   - Reduced polling frequency (30-60 seconds)
   - Batch query invalidations
   - Focus on critical data only

3. **Network Recovery Strategy**
   - Process offline queue with priority ordering
   - Gradual ramp-up of sync frequency
   - Verify data consistency before resuming real-time
   - Handle conflict resolution for queued updates

4. **Multi-Tab Coordination**
   - Elect primary tab for WebSocket connection
   - Share updates via BroadcastChannel
   - Coordinate polling to avoid duplicates
   - Sync local storage state changes

## Subtasks
- [ ] Implement tab visibility detection with pause/resume logic
- [ ] Configure dynamic refetch intervals based on tab state
- [ ] Integrate WebSocket connection with TanStack Query
- [ ] Create BroadcastChannel for multi-tab coordination
- [ ] Implement network status aware sync strategies
- [ ] Add stale data indicators to UI components
- [ ] Configure cascade invalidation for related queries
- [ ] Create performance monitoring for sync operations
- [ ] Add configuration UI for sync preferences
- [ ] Write integration tests for sync scenarios
