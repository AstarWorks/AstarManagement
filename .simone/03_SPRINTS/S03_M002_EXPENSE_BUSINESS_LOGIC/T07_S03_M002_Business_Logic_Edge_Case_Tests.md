# T07_S03_M002_Business_Logic_Edge_Case_Tests.md

## Task Meta Information
- **Task ID**: T07_S03_M002
- **Task Name**: Business Logic Edge Case Tests
- **Sprint**: S03_M002_EXPENSE_BUSINESS_LOGIC
- **Estimated Hours**: 3
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Pending
- **Assigned**: Backend Developer
- **Dependencies**: 
  - All service implementations must be completed
  - Business rules must be clearly defined
  - Domain models must be finalized

## Purpose
Create comprehensive edge case tests across all business logic components to ensure system robustness, proper error handling, and graceful degradation under unusual conditions. Focus on boundary conditions, concurrent operations, and complex interaction scenarios.

## Research Findings
Based on analysis of the expense management system:

### Critical Edge Cases Identified
1. Financial calculation precision issues
2. Concurrent modification scenarios
3. Multi-tenant boundary conditions
4. Date and timezone edge cases
5. Maximum limits and resource constraints
6. Data consistency during failures

### Areas Requiring Edge Case Testing
- Balance calculations with extreme values
- Tag usage under high concurrency
- Attachment operations during storage failures
- Expense filtering with complex criteria
- Soft delete and recovery scenarios

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All identified edge cases have tests
- [ ] Concurrent operation safety is verified
- [ ] Financial calculations maintain precision
- [ ] System limits are properly enforced
- [ ] Error messages are meaningful
- [ ] No data corruption under edge conditions
- [ ] Performance degradation is graceful
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms work correctly
