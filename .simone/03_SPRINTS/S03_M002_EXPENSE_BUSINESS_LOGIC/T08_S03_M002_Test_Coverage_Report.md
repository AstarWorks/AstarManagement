# T08_S03_M002_Test_Coverage_Report.md

## Task Meta Information
- **Task ID**: T08_S03_M002
- **Task Name**: Test Coverage Report & Gap Analysis
- **Sprint**: S03_M002_EXPENSE_BUSINESS_LOGIC
- **Estimated Hours**: 2
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Status**: Pending
- **Assigned**: Backend Developer
- **Dependencies**: 
  - All other test tasks in this sprint must be completed
  - JaCoCo or similar coverage tool must be configured
  - CI/CD pipeline should generate coverage reports

## Purpose
Generate comprehensive test coverage reports for the business logic layer, identify coverage gaps, document untested code paths, and create an action plan for achieving the target >80% coverage requirement.

## Research Findings
Based on current analysis:

### Current Coverage Status
- ExpenseService: Partial coverage exists
- TagService: No tests found
- AttachmentService: No tests found
- Mappers: No tests found
- Overall business logic coverage: Estimated <30%

### Target Coverage Goals
- Minimum: 80% line coverage
- Recommended: 90% line coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage
- Generated code: Excluded from metrics

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Coverage report generated for all business logic
- [ ] Detailed gap analysis documented
- [ ] Untested code paths identified
- [ ] Risk assessment for uncovered code
- [ ] Action plan created for coverage improvement
- [ ] Coverage metrics integrated into CI/CD
- [ ] Coverage trends tracked over time
- [ ] Critical paths have 100% coverage

## Technical Implementation Details

### Coverage Report Generation

1. **Configure JaCoCo**
   ```kotlin
   jacoco {
       toolVersion = "0.8.8"
   }
   
   tasks.jacocoTestReport {
       reports {
           xml.required.set(true)
           html.required.set(true)
           csv.required.set(true)
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Coverage Exclusions**
   ```kotlin
   tasks.jacocoTestCoverageVerification {
       violationRules {
           rule {
               excludes = listOf(
                   "*.dto.*",
                   "*.config.*",
                   "*.entity.*"
               )
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Gap Analysis Structure

1. **Service Layer Analysis**
   - ExpenseService gaps
   - TagService gaps  
   - AttachmentService gaps
   - Transaction boundary coverage
   - Exception path coverage

2. **Mapper Analysis**
   - ExpenseMapper coverage
   - TagMapper coverage
   - AttachmentMapper coverage
   - Null handling paths
   - Collection mapping paths

3. **Business Rule Analysis**
   - Validation logic coverage
   - Calculation accuracy tests
   - State transition coverage
   - Permission check coverage

### Report Template

```markdown
## Test Coverage Report - S03_M002

### Executive Summary
- Overall Coverage: X%
- Line Coverage: X%
- Branch Coverage: X%
- Complexity Coverage: X%

### Coverage by Component
| Component | Line Coverage | Branch Coverage | Status |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| ExpenseService | X% | X% | ⚠️ Below Target |
| TagService | X% | X% | ❌ Critical |
| AttachmentService | X% | X% | ❌ Critical |
| ExpenseMapper | X% | X% | ❌ Missing |

### Critical Gaps
1. **Uncovered Critical Paths**
   - Path: ExpenseService.calculateBalance()
   - Risk: High - Financial calculations
   - Action: Immediate test implementation

### Risk Assessment
- High Risk: Financial calculations, Security validations
- Medium Risk: Data mappings, Validations
- Low Risk: Logging, Metrics
```

### Action Plan Template

1. **Immediate Actions (Sprint S03)**
   - Complete all planned test tasks
   - Focus on critical financial paths
   - Achieve 80% minimum coverage

2. **Short-term Actions (Next Sprint)**
   - Address remaining gaps
   - Improve branch coverage
   - Add integration tests

3. **Long-term Actions**
   - Maintain coverage above 85%
   - Automate coverage monitoring
   - Implement mutation testing

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/coverage.yml
- name: Generate Coverage Report
  run: ./gradlew jacocoTestReport

- name: Upload Coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    file: ./build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml
    fail_ci_if_error: true
    verbose: true
```

### Coverage Monitoring
- Set up coverage badges in README
- Configure coverage trend graphs
- Set up alerts for coverage drops
- Regular coverage reviews in sprint retrospectives

### Tools and Metrics
- JaCoCo for Java/Kotlin coverage
- SonarQube for code quality metrics
- Codecov for coverage tracking
- GitHub Actions for automation

## Dependencies
- JaCoCo Gradle plugin
- Codecov integration
- SonarQube (optional)
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
