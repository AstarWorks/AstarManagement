# T01_S03_M002_ExpenseService_Unit_Tests.md

## Task Meta Information
- **Task ID**: T01_S03_M002
- **Task Name**: ExpenseService Unit Tests
- **Sprint**: S03_M002_EXPENSE_BUSINESS_LOGIC
- **Estimated Hours**: 4
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Status**: Pending
- **Assigned**: Backend Developer
- **Dependencies**: 
  - ExpenseService implementation must be completed
  - Domain models and DTOs must be finalized
  - Test fixtures must be available

## Purpose
Expand and enhance the existing ExpenseService unit tests to achieve comprehensive coverage of all business logic, edge cases, and error scenarios. Ensure the service layer properly handles validation, calculations, and business rules.

## Research Findings
Based on analysis of existing implementation:

### Current ExpenseService Coverage
Located in `backend/src/test/kotlin/com/astarworks/astarmanagement/expense/application/service/ExpenseServiceTest.kt`:
- Basic CRUD operations are tested
- Some tag association tests exist
- Missing coverage for:
  - Complex filtering scenarios
  - Concurrent modification handling
  - Business rule validations
  - Performance edge cases

### ExpenseService Implementation
- Handles expense CRUD operations
- Manages tag associations
- Performs balance calculations
- Enforces tenant isolation
- Supports bulk operations

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Test coverage reaches >90% for ExpenseService
- [ ] All public methods have unit tests
- [ ] Business rules are validated through tests
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are covered
- [ ] Mock dependencies are properly isolated
- [ ] Tests are maintainable and well-documented
- [ ] Performance assertions are included
- [ ] Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Test Categories to Implement

1. **Enhanced CRUD Tests**
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun `should handle concurrent expense updates with optimistic locking`()
   @Test
   fun `should validate expense amounts according to business rules`()
   @Test
   fun `should handle maximum expense amount limits`()
   ```

2. **Complex Filtering Tests**
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun `should filter expenses by multiple criteria efficiently`()
   @Test
   fun `should handle date range edge cases`()
   @Test
   fun `should paginate large result sets correctly`()
   ```

3. **Business Rule Validation**
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun `should prevent expenses with both income and expense amounts`()
   @Test
   fun `should enforce category validation rules`()
   @Test
   fun `should validate expense date constraints`()
   ```

4. **Tag Management Edge Cases**
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun `should handle tag limit per expense`()
   @Test
   fun `should update tag usage statistics correctly`()
   @Test
   fun `should handle deleted tags gracefully`()
   ```

5. **Calculation Accuracy**
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun `should calculate balance with proper decimal precision`()
   @Test
   fun `should handle currency rounding correctly`()
   @Test
   fun `should aggregate totals accurately`()
   ```

6. **Error Handling**
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun `should throw appropriate exceptions for invalid operations`()
   @Test
   fun `should handle repository failures gracefully`()
   @Test
   fun `should provide meaningful error messages`()
   ```

7. **Performance Tests**
   ```kotlin
   @Test
   fun `should process bulk operations within performance thresholds`()
   @Test
   fun `should handle large tag sets efficiently`()
   ```

### Mock Configuration
```kotlin
@BeforeEach
fun setUp() {
    // Enhanced mock setup with behavior verification
    // Strict mocking for better test reliability
    // Performance measurement setup
}
```

### Test Data Builders
- Enhanced expense builders for various scenarios
- Tag builders with different scopes
- Error condition simulators

## Dependencies
- Mockito-Kotlin for mocking
- AssertJ for fluent assertions
- JUnit 5 for test framework
- Test fixtures and builders
