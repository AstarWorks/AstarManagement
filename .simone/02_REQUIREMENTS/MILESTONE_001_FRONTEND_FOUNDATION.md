# MILESTONE_001_FRONTEND_FOUNDATION

## Milestone Overview
**Milestone ID**: MILESTONE_001_FRONTEND_FOUNDATION  
**Priority**: Critical (High Priority - Frontend First)  
**Status**: Planned  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Depends On**: None (Independent frontend development with mock data)  
**Enables**: All subsequent milestones require this UI foundation  

## Milestone Goal
Establish a complete frontend foundation for the legal practice management system, implementing all core UI components, pages, and workflows using mock data. This enables legal practitioners to immediately use the system for case and client management while backend development proceeds in parallel.

## Business Value
- **Immediate User Feedback**: Legal practitioners can interact with the system and provide feedback
- **Parallel Development**: Frontend and backend teams can work independently
- **Risk Reduction**: UI/UX validation before backend integration
- **FAstar Time to Market**: Users see working system immediately
