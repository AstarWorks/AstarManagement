- **Deliverables**:
  - AuthStore with login/logout/refresh actions
  - Token persistence in localStorage/sessionStorage
  - Automatic token refresh mechanism
  - Store unit tests with Vitest

#### UI-003: Route Guards Implementation
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimate**: 1-2 days
- **Description**: Protect routes based on authentication status
- **Deliverables**:
  - `auth.ts` middleware for authenticated routes
  - `rbac.ts` middleware for role-based access
  - Redirect logic for unauthorized access
  - Route guard integration tests

#### UI-004: Basic Layout System
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimate**: 3-5 days
- **Description**: Create foundational layout with navigation
- **Deliverables**:
  - DefaultLayout with header and sidebar
  - Responsive navigation component
  - User menu with logout functionality
  - Mobile-friendly navigation drawer
  - Layout component tests

## Architecture Decisions

### Authentication Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Frontend
    participant B as Backend
    participant D as Database
    
    U->>F: Enter credentials
    F->>B: POST /api/auth/login
    B->>D: Validate user
    D-->>B: User data
    B-->>F: JWT + Refresh tokens
    F->>F: Store tokens
    F-->>U: Redirect to dashboard
    
    Note over F,B: Subsequent requests include JWT
    F->>B: API call with JWT header
    B->>B: Validate JWT
    B-->>F: Protected data
```

### Technology Choices
- **JWT over Sessions**: Stateless authentication for scalability
- **Refresh Tokens**: Security without frequent re-authentication
- **Pinia over Vuex**: Modern state management with TypeScript support
- **VeeValidate + Zod**: Type-safe form validation

## Definition of Done

### Code Quality
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation passes (`bun run typecheck`)
- [ ] Unit tests achieve >80% coverage
- [ ] Storybook stories created for all components
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier formatting applied
- [ ] Kotlin code passes ktlint checks

### Functionality
- [ ] Manual testing completed on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Error scenarios properly handled
- [ ] Performance meets targets (<300ms API responses)

### Documentation
- [ ] API endpoints documented in Swagger
- [ ] Component usage documented in Storybook
- [ ] Architecture decisions recorded in ADRs

### Security Review
- [ ] Security checklist completed
- [ ] Penetration testing of auth endpoints
- [ ] Audit logging verification
- [ ] Input validation testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **JWT Implementation Complexity**: Mitigation - Use proven Spring Security patterns
- **Frontend/Backend Integration**: Mitigation - Early integration testing

### Medium Risk  
- **RBAC Complexity**: Mitigation - Start with simple roles, iterate
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Mitigation - Mobile-first design approach

### Low Risk
- **Performance**: Mitigation - Simple caching strategies
- **User Experience**: Mitigation - Regular stakeholder feedback

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Spring Security 6.x
- PostgreSQL 15 
- Redis (for session storage)
- JWT libraries (jjwt for backend, @vueuse/jwt for frontend)

### Internal Dependencies
- Database schema must be designed first
- Development environment setup completed
- Storybook configuration established

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **API Response Time**: <200ms for auth endpoints
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for auth-related code
- **Build Time**: <30 seconds for full frontend build
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB for auth-related frontend code

### User Experience Metrics
- **Login Time**: <3 seconds from form submission to dashboard
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages for all failure scenarios
- **Mobile Experience**: Functional on devices >320px width
