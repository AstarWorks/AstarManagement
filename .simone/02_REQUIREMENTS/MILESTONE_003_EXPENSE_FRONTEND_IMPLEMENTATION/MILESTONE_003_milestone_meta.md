# MILESTONE_003: Expense Frontend Implementation

## Overview
Implement the expense management frontend system to provide a complete user interface for expense tracking, reporting, and management. This milestone builds upon the backend implementation (M002) to deliver a fully functional expense management solution.

## Goals

1. **User-Friendly Expense Management**
   - Intuitive expense entry forms with real-time validation
   - Comprehensive expense listing with advanced filtering
   - Detailed expense views with edit capabilities
   - Mobile-responsive design for field access

2. **Advanced Features**
   - CSV import functionality for bulk expense entry
   - Reporting and analytics dashboards
   - File attachment management for receipts
   - Tag-based categorization system

3. **Seamless Integration**
   - Connect to M002 backend APIs
   - Integrate with existing dashboard navigation
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
   - Ensure data consistency and validation

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Performance optimization for large datasets
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Accessibility compliance
   - Cross-browser compatibility

## Key Documents

- **API Specs**: `/docs/40-specs/04-feature-specs/expense-input/expense-api-endpoints.md`
- **UI Design**: Expense management UI mockups (TBD)
- **Integration Guide**: Backend API integration patterns

## Definition of Done

## Sprint Structure

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Routing (COMPLETED)
- TypeScript interfaces and types
- i18n setup for Japanese market
- Routing structure and navigation
- Basic page scaffolding

### Sprint 2: Core Features
- Expense list view with filtering
- Expense creation form
- Expense detail/edit views
- Basic CRUD operations

### Sprint 3: Advanced Features
- CSV import interface
- File attachment management
- Reporting dashboards
- Tag management system

### Sprint 4: Integration & Polish
- Full backend integration
- Performance optimization
- Error handling refinement
- Production deployment prep

## Technical Approach

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Vue 3 with Nuxt.js
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **Forms**: VeeValidate
- **Testing**: Vitest, Playwright

### Development Principles
- Component-driven development
- Accessibility-first approach
- Mobile-responsive by default
- Progressive enhancement
- Type safety throughout

## Dependencies

- Completed M002 backend APIs
- Authentication system from M001
- Dashboard framework from M001
- Design system components

## Success Metrics

- **User Satisfaction**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal training
- **Performance**: All interactions <200ms
- **Reliability**: <0.1% error rate in production
- **Mobile Usage**: 30%+ of expense entries from mobile
- **Data Accuracy**: 100% consistency with backend

## Risk Assessment

### Medium Risks
- **API Integration Complexity**: Mitigated by mock services and iterative integration
- **Performance with Large Datasets**: Mitigated by pagination and virtual scrolling
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Mitigated by progressive enhancement

### Low Risks
- **Design Consistency**: Mitigated by using established design system
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Mitigated by automated testing tools

## Notes/Context

This milestone delivers the user-facing component of the expense management system, completing the full-stack implementation started in M002. The focus is on creating an intuitive, efficient interface that legal professionals can use with minimal training while ensuring robust data handling and integration with the backend systems.
