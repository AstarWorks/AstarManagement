# Product Requirements Document: Expense Backend Implementation

## Document Information
- **Milestone**: MILESTONE_002
- **Feature**: Expense Management Backend
- **Created**: 2025-08-03
- **Status**: Draft

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing the expense management backend system for Astar Management. The system will enable law firms to track expenses, manage receipts, categorize spending with tags, and generate financial reports.

## Problem Statement

Law firms need to accurately track case-related expenses and office expenditures for:
- Client billing and reimbursement
- Financial reporting and analysis
- Tax compliance and auditing
- Budget management and forecasting

Currently, many firms rely on manual spreadsheets or paper-based systems, leading to errors, inefficiencies, and delayed reimbursements.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. Enable accurate expense tracking with minimal data entry effort
2. Support receipt attachment and document management
3. Provide real-time balance calculations and reporting
4. Ensure data integrity and security for financial information

### Success Metrics
- 90% reduction in expense entry time compared to manual methods
- Zero data loss or corruption incidents
- <200ms response time for all API operations
- 100% audit trail coverage for financial transactions

## User Stories

### Expense Entry
- **As a** lawyer, **I want to** quickly record expenses **so that** I can track costs without interrupting my work
- **As a** secretary, **I want to** bulk enter multiple expenses **so that** I can efficiently process receipts

### Receipt Management
- **As a** user, **I want to** attach receipt images to expenses **so that** I have documentation for reimbursements
- **As an** admin, **I want to** enforce receipt requirements **so that** we maintain compliance

### Categorization
- **As a** user, **I want to** tag expenses with multiple categories **so that** I can analyze spending patterns
- **As a** team lead, **I want to** create shared tags **so that** our team uses consistent categorization

### Reporting
- **As a** manager, **I want to** view expense reports by case/period/category **so that** I can monitor budgets
- **As an** accountant, **I want to** export expense data **so that** I can prepare financial statements

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

#### 1. Expense CRUD Operations
- Create single or bulk expenses
- Update expense details with audit trail
- Soft delete with recovery option
- List/search with filters and pagination

#### 2. Data Fields
- **Required**: Date, amount, description, type (income/expense)
- **Optional**: Case association, tags, memo, receipt
- **Calculated**: Running balance, category totals

#### 3. Tag Management
- Personal tags (user-specific)
- Shared tags (tenant-wide)
- Tag colors and emoji support
- Usage statistics and suggestions

#### 4. File Attachments
- Receipt image upload (JPEG, PNG, PDF)
- Multiple attachments per expense
- Thumbnail generation
- OCR text extraction (future)

#### 5. Balance Calculations
- Real-time balance updates
- Period-based summaries
- Case-specific balances
- Multi-currency support (future)

### API Endpoints

```
POST   /api/v1/expenses
GET    /api/v1/expenses
GET    /api/v1/expenses/{id}
PUT    /api/v1/expenses/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/expenses/{id}

POST   /api/v1/expenses/bulk
GET    /api/v1/expenses/balance
GET    /api/v1/expenses/summary

POST   /api/v1/tags
GET    /api/v1/tags
PUT    /api/v1/tags/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/tags/{id}

POST   /api/v1/attachments
GET    /api/v1/attachments/{id}
DELETE /api/v1/attachments/{id}
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API response time < 200ms (95th percentile)
- Support 1000 concurrent users
- Handle 100,000 expenses per tenant

### Security
- Tenant data isolation (multi-tenancy)
- Role-based access control
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Input validation and sanitization

### Reliability
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Automated backups every 6 hours
- Transaction rollback capability
- Audit log retention for 7 years

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Database partitioning by tenant
- Caching strategy for calculations

## Integration Requirements

### Frontend Integration
- RESTful API consumption
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (future)
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback

### External Systems
- Supabase Storage for file attachments
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- Redis for caching (future)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Must use existing Spring Boot framework
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Assumptions
- Users have stable internet connection
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness not required for MVP

## Timeline & Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sprint 1-2)
- Basic CRUD operations
- Database schema implementation
- Initial API endpoints

### Phase 2: Core Features (Sprint 3-4)
- Tag management
- File attachments
- Balance calculations

### Phase 3: Integration (Sprint 5)
- Frontend connection
- Testing and optimization
- Documentation completion

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data migration complexity | High | Incremental migration with rollback plans |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Implement caching and query optimization |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Regular security audits and penetration testing |

## Out of Scope

- Multi-currency conversion
- OCR receipt processing
- Mobile native applications
- Third-party accounting software integration
- Automated expense approval workflows
