# MILESTONE_002: Expense Backend Implementation

## Overview
Implement the expense management backend system using an iterative, test-driven approach. This milestone focuses on building the backend infrastructure for expense tracking, gradually evolving from basic framework to full frontend integration.

## Goals

1. **Establish Backend Foundation**
   - Set up Spring Boot expense module structure
   - Configure database connections and migrations
   - Implement basic CRUD operations

2. **Implement Core Features**
   - Expense entry management (create, read, update, delete)
   - Tag management system (personal and shared tags)
   - File attachment handling for receipts
   - Balance calculation engine

3. **Ensure Quality Through Testing**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Manual testing checkpoints after each sprint
   - Performance testing for calculations

4. **Complete Frontend Integration**
   - Connect existing frontend to real backend APIs
   - Replace mock data with actual database operations
   - Ensure smooth data flow and error handling

## Key Documents

- **PRD**: `PRD_EXPENSE_BACKEND.md` - Product requirements for expense backend
- **SPECS**: `SPECS_EXPENSE_API.md` - Technical specifications for API implementation
- **TEST_PLAN**: `TEST_PLAN_EXPENSE.md` - Comprehensive testing strategy

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All expense CRUD APIs functional with proper error handling
- [ ] Database schema implemented with migrations (V018-V025)
- [ ] Tag management system operational (personal & shared tags)
- [ ] File upload system working for receipt attachments
- [ ] Balance calculations accurate and performant
- [ ] All unit tests passing with >80% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests covering all API endpoints
- [ ] Manual UAT completed and documented
- [ ] Frontend successfully consuming real backend data
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (response time <200ms)
- [ ] Security measures implemented (tenant isolation, input validation)
- [ ] API documentation updated in OpenAPI format

## Sprint Structure

### Sprint 1: Basic API Framework
- Spring Boot module setup
- Basic controller structure
- Repository interfaces
- Initial database schema

### Sprint 2: Database Implementation
- Complete schema with all tables
- Flyway migrations
- Test data seeders
- Repository implementations

### Sprint 3: Business Logic
- Service layer implementation
- Validation rules
- Balance calculation logic
- Error handling

### Sprint 4: Advanced Features
- Tag management
- File attachments
- Reporting queries
- Performance optimization

### Sprint 5: Integration & Testing
- Frontend integration
- End-to-end testing
- Performance tuning
- Production readiness

## Technical Approach

### Iterative Development Cycle
1. **Implement** - Build minimal working version
2. **Connect** - Wire to database
3. **Test** - Automated tests
4. **Validate** - Human testing
5. **Refine** - Improve based on feedback

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Kotlin)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Flyway
- **Testing**: JUnit, MockK, REST Assured
- **API Docs**: OpenAPI/Swagger

## Dependencies

- Completed expense-input documentation in `docs/40-specs/expense-input/`
- Frontend components from MILESTONE_001
- Database infrastructure setup

## Success Metrics

- API response time < 200ms for all endpoints
- Zero critical bugs in production
- 100% of planned features implemented
- Smooth frontend integration with no data loss
- Positive feedback from manual testing

## Notes/Context

This milestone emphasizes quality through iterative development and comprehensive testing. Each sprint builds upon the previous one, with testing gates ensuring stability before proceeding. The approach allows for early detection of issues and continuous refinement based on real usage patterns.

The expense management system is a core feature for Phase 1 of the Astar Management system, directly supporting the law firm's need for accurate financial tracking and reporting.
