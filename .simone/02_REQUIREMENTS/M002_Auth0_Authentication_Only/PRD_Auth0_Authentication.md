# Product Requirements Document: Auth0 Authentication

## Overview

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing authentication-only functionality using Auth0 as the identity provider for the Astar Management platform.

## Business Objectives

1. **Reduce Security Risk**: Delegate authentication to industry-leading provider
2. **Improve User Experience**: Professional login interface with better UX
3. **Enable Future Features**: Foundation for SSO, MFA, social login
4. **Reduce Maintenance**: Eliminate custom authentication code maintenance
5. **Compliance Ready**: Meet security standards and audit requirements

## User Stories

### As a User

1. **Login Flow**
   - I want to click "Login" and be taken to a professional login page
   - I want to enter my credentials securely
   - I want to be redirected back to the application after login
   - I want my session to persist across browser refreshes

2. **Logout Flow**
   - I want to click "Logout" and be completely signed out
   - I want to be redirected to a landing page after logout
   - I want my session cleared from both app and Auth0

3. **Session Management**
   - I want to stay logged in for a reasonable period
   - I want my session to refresh automatically
   - I want clear feedback if my session expires

### As a New User

1. **First Login**
   - I want to be automatically registered on first login
   - I want my profile information populated from Auth0
   - I want immediate access after authentication

### As an Administrator

1. **User Management**
   - I want users managed through Auth0 dashboard
   - I want to disable/enable user accounts
   - I want to see authentication logs

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication Flow

1. **Login Process**
   - Redirect to Auth0 Universal Login
   - Support email/password authentication
   - Return to original requested page after login
   - Handle authentication errors gracefully

2. **Token Management**
   - Store tokens securely in browser
   - Refresh tokens before expiration
   - Clear tokens on logout
   - Handle token validation failures

3. **User Provisioning**
   - Create user record on first login
   - Sync profile data from Auth0
   - Maintain tenant association
   - Update user info on each login

### Security Requirements

1. **Token Security**
   - Use secure token storage
   - Implement token rotation
   - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
   - Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)

2. **Communication Security**
   - All Auth0 communication over HTTPS
   - Validate JWT signatures
   - Verify token audience and issuer

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Login completion: <3 seconds
- Token validation: <50ms
- Page load with auth check: <500ms

### Availability
- 99.9% authentication availability
- Graceful handling of Auth0 outages
- Clear error messages for users

### Scalability
- Support 1000+ concurrent users
- Handle token refresh spikes
- Efficient JWKS caching

## User Interface Requirements

### Login Page
- Clean, professional appearance
- Astar Management branding
- Loading states during redirect
- Error message display

### Application UI
- User profile display (name, avatar)
- Login/Logout button visibility
- Session status indicators
- Loading states during auth operations

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
# Auth0 Configuration
AUTH0_DOMAIN=
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=
AUTH0_ISSUER=

# Application URLs
APP_URL=
AUTH_CALLBACK_URL=
AUTH_LOGOUT_URL=
```

### Auth0 Tenant Settings
- Application type: Single Page Application
- Allowed Callback URLs
- Allowed Logout URLs
- Allowed Web Origins
- Refresh Token Rotation: Enabled

## Migration Requirements

1. **User Data**
   - Export existing users from database
   - Import to Auth0 with email verification skipped
   - Maintain user IDs for data consistency

2. **Database Changes**
   - Add auth0_sub column to users table
   - Remove password_hash column (after migration)
   - Update user creation logic

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Success**
   - All users can login via Auth0
   - Sessions persist correctly
   - Logout works completely
   - New users are provisioned automatically

2. **Technical Success**
   - Zero password storage in database
   - All API endpoints protected
   - Token refresh works seamlessly
   - No authentication bypasses

3. **User Experience Success**
   - Login process is intuitive
   - No increase in login time
   - Clear error messages
   - Smooth transition from old system

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT part of this milestone:

- Role-based authorization
- Permission management
- Multi-factor authentication
- Social login providers
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- User profile management UI
- Admin user management features

## Dependencies

- Auth0 tenant provisioning
- Frontend framework (Nuxt/Sidebase) setup
- Backend framework (Spring Boot) configuration
- Database migration capabilities

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Backend implementation
- **Week 2**: Frontend implementation
- **Week 3**: Testing and deployment

## Appendix

### Auth0 Universal Login Customization

Basic branding only:
- Logo upload
- Primary color configuration
- Company name display

### Error Handling Matrix

| Error | User Message | Technical Action |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| Network failure | "Connection error. Please try again." | Retry with backoff |
| Invalid credentials | "Invalid email or password." | Log attempt |
| Token expired | "Session expired. Please login again." | Redirect to login |
| Auth0 down | "Authentication service unavailable." | Show status page |
