## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Architecture

#### JWT Implementation (RS256)
- **Algorithm**: RS256 (asymmetric encryption)
- **Access Token**: 15 minutes lifespan
- **Refresh Token**: 7 days, stored in Redis with immediate revocation capability
- **Key Rotation**: Automated 3-month rotation cycle
- **Token Structure**: Includes user ID, role, permissions, tenant context

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- **TOTP Implementation**: Google Authenticator compatible
- **Backup Codes**: 10 single-use recovery codes
- **QR Code Generation**: Secure setup flow
- **Time Window**: ±30 seconds tolerance for clock skew

#### Password Security
- **Policy**: 12+ chars, complexity requirements, 90-day expiration
- **Hashing**: bcrypt with cost factor 12
- **History**: Prevent reuse of last 5 passwords
- **Breach Detection**: Integration with HaveIBeenPwned API

### Authorization (RBAC) System

#### Legal Practice Roles
```yaml
roles:
  admin:
    name: "システム管理者"
    permissions: ["*:*"]
    
  lawyer:
    name: "弁護士"
    permissions:
      - "case:*"
      - "document:*"  
      - "client:*"
      - "invoice:create,read,update"
      - "user:read"
      
  clerk:
    name: "事務員"
    permissions:
      - "case:read,update"
      - "document:*"
      - "task:*"
      - "expense:*"
      - "invoice:read"
      
  client:
    name: "依頼者"
    permissions:
      - "case:read:own"
      - "document:read:own"
      - "invoice:read:own"
```

#### Permission Model
- **Resource-based**: Permissions tied to specific resources (cases, documents)
- **Hierarchical**: Lawyers inherit clerk permissions, admins inherit all
- **Contextual**: "own" permissions limit access to user's own data
- **Tenant-scoped**: All permissions automatically scoped to user's tenant

### Comprehensive Audit System

#### Security Event Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-26T10:30:00Z",
  "eventType": "authentication_failure",
  "userId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "email": "user@lawfirm.com",
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "details": {
    "reason": "invalid_password",
    "attemptCount": 3,
    "accountLocked": false
  },
  "riskScore": 75,
  "geoLocation": "Tokyo, Japan"
}
```

#### Audit Event Types
1. **Authentication Events**: Login, logout, MFA, password changes
2. **Authorization Events**: Permission grants, role changes, access denials
3. **Data Access Events**: Case views, document downloads, sensitive data access
4. **Security Events**: Suspicious activity, brute force attempts, privilege escalation
5. **System Events**: Configuration changes, user management, backup operations

### Application Security (OWASP Top 10)

#### 1. Injection Prevention
- **SQL Injection**: JPA with parameterized queries only
- **Command Injection**: No system command execution
- **LDAP Injection**: Input validation for directory queries

#### 2. Broken Authentication
- **Secure Session Management**: JWT with proper expiration
- **Account Lockout**: Progressive delays after failed attempts
- **Credential Security**: No credentials in logs or error messages

#### 3. Sensitive Data Exposure
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive database fields
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 mandatory
- **Data Masking**: PII masked in logs and non-production environments

#### 4. XML External Entities (XXE)
- **XML Processing**: Disabled external entity processing
- **File Upload**: Strict file type validation
- **Document Processing**: Sandboxed document parsing

#### 5. Broken Access Control
- **Method-level Security**: @PreAuthorize on all sensitive endpoints
- **Object-level Security**: Resource-specific permission checks
- **Tenant Isolation**: Row-level security preventing cross-tenant access

### Security Monitoring & Alerting

#### Real-time Monitoring
- **Failed Login Attempts**: 5+ attempts in 5 minutes
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized role/permission changes
- **Suspicious Data Access**: Mass data exports, unusual access patterns
- **Geographic Anomalies**: Logins from unexpected locations
- **Time-based Anomalies**: Access outside normal business hours
