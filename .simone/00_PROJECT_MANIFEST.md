# Project Manifest: Aster Management

This manifest serves as the central reference point for the project. It tracks the current focus and links to key documentation.

## 1. Project Vision & Overview

Aster Management is a comprehensive legal case management system designed to digitize and streamline law firm operations. It addresses the challenges of scattered case files, paper-based workflows, and limited visibility into case progress by providing a centralized, AI-powered platform for matter management, document processing, and client communication.

This project follows a milestone-based development approach.

## 2. Current Focus

- **Milestone:** M02 - Frontend Framework Migration
