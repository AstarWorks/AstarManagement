        OWASP Dependency Check Suppressions for Aster Management
        
        This file contains suppressions for known false positives in dependency vulnerability scanning.
        Each suppression should include:
        1. A clear explanation of why it's suppressed
        2. The CVE or vulnerability being suppressed
        3. The specific library affected
        4. An expiration date for review

    <!-- Example suppressions - these should be reviewed and updated as needed -->

        NOTE: This file should be regularly reviewed and updated.
        Remove suppressions when:
        1. The underlying vulnerability is fixed in a new version
        2. We upgrade to a version that doesn't have the vulnerability
        3. The suppression expires (review date passed)
        
        Add new suppressions when:
        1. A new false positive is identified
        2. A vulnerability is assessed as not applicable to our use case
        3. A vulnerability is accepted risk with appropriate controls
