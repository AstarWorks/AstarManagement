## 4. Acceptance Criteria Template

```gherkin
Given <precondition>
When  <action>
Then  <expected result>
```

Each ticket's **Acceptance Criteria** should follow this BDD format to ensure clarity and enable direct translation to testing frameworks like Playwright or Cucumber.

### Example:

```gherkin
# FR-001: Keycloak OIDC Login with 2FA
Given a user with valid credentials and 2FA enabled
When the user attempts to log in with username/password
Then the system should prompt for TOTP code
And grant access only after valid TOTP verification
```

## 5. Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

* All APIs must follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification
* Authentication tokens should expire after 24 hours of inactivity
* File uploads must validate MIME types and scan for malware
* Search indices should update within 30 seconds of document changes
* All user actions must generate audit log entries

### Performance Requirements

* API response time: P95 < 500ms (excluding file operations)
* Concurrent user support: 100+ simultaneous sessions
* Database query optimization: Use indexes for all foreign keys
* File storage: Support up to 10TB total capacity
