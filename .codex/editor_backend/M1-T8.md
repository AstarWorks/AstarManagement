# M1-T8 – Editor Documentation & Feature Toggle Guidance

## Goal
Provide developer-facing documentation for the editor module, explaining the feature flag, endpoint surface, and how to enable the plaintext CRUD APIs during M1.

## Deliverables
- A dedicated backend docs page that summarizes the module, toggle usage, and current limitations.
- Updates to the backend feature index so the editor service appears alongside other implemented capabilities.
- Context file entry so future sessions understand the toggle state and doc location.

## What Was Done
- Added `docs/backend/features/editor/README.md` describing the module overview, API list, envelope format, and step-by-step instructions for enabling `app.features.editor.enabled` (either via `local` profile or environment variable).
- Linked the new documentation from `docs/backend/README.md` by expanding the implemented feature list with “ドキュメント管理 (M1: 平文版)”.
- Logged completion details and toggle notes in `.codex/context.md` for session continuity.

## Verification
- Documentation-only change; no automated tests were executed.

## Follow-ups / Notes
- When encryption (M2) lands, extend the doc with DEK/KEK handling, new response fields, and any migration steps.
- Consider adding OpenAPI references or curl snippets that include real JWT samples once auth scaffolding stabilizes.
