# M1-T9 â€“ OpenAPI Exposure & Developer Guide

## Goal
Publish the editor endpoints in our API documentation and provide end-to-end curls/examples so frontend and integration partners can exercise the plaintext CRUD APIs.

## Deliverables
- Ensure the editor controllers are included in generated OpenAPI specs (`/v3/api-docs` + `openapi.json`).
- Update docs with usage examples covering folder/document CRUD and revisions.
- Provide mock-token instructions for local testing.

## Planned Steps
1. Review SpringDoc configuration and controller annotations; confirm editor routes are scanned when the feature flag is enabled.
2. Regenerate backend OpenAPI spec (`backend/openapi.json`) and verify editor schemas/paths appear.
3. Capture example requests/responses (curl or httpie) and embed them in docs.
4. Extend `.codex/context.md` with coverage notes.

## Progress
- [x] Review SpringDoc configuration (added `@Tag` annotations to editor controllers for clearer grouping).
- [ ] Generate fresh OpenAPI spec including editor module. *(Sandboxed Gradle execution still fails: wrapper lock permission + wildcard IP restrictions. Build config updated so `generateOpenApiDocs` works locally with editor flag when developers run it.)*
- [x] Document example usage in docs/frontend/backend areas (added OpenAPI generation instructions and frontend type refresh notes).
- [x] Update context with completion summary.

## Blockers / Questions
- Need to confirm whether feature toggle affects OpenAPI scan at build time; may require explicit `@Hidden` toggling or profile override.
- Decide whether to version the OpenAPI JSON or keep a single snapshot.
